When  wearing  or  binder  are  substituted  for \nbinder  or base,  the  allowable  RAP  percentage  shall meet  the  intended  use \nspecified in Table 502-6. \n When a 501 finish  course and  a  502  wearing  course  are  required  on  a \nproject, allowable  RAP  percentage for  wearing may meet  binder  course \nrequirement.   \n \n 502.04 JOB   MIX   FORMULA   VALIDATION AND   APPROVAL.  \n The Department and contractor will jointly test plant mix to validate each \nJMF  for  mainline  mixture  and  accept  each JMF  whenever  a  plant  begins \ninitial operations for the Department in a specific plant location, or whenever \na plant experiences a change in materials or change in source of materials, \nor when there are significant changes in equipment, such as the introduction \nof a new crusher, drum mixer, burner, foaming device, etc.  Evaluate each \nJMF at  least  once every  two  years.    Meet  LWT  requirements  and all \napplicable requirements of Table 502-6.  \n For Minor Mixes, validation is not required for mixture designs, but the \nmixture  must  meet  specification  requirements. In  order  to  validate  minor \nmixes, the plant G\nmm \nmust be determined. \nThe average of the first five (5) plant G\nmm\ns will become the new JMF target. \n For  all  mixes,  validation is  not  required  when  the  asphalt  grade  has \nchanged or asphalt source  has changed, but must meet LWT requirements \nand all applicable requirements of Table 502-6. \n 502.04.1  Validation Plant Lot:  The validation plant lot (“VP-lot”), \nis a maximum of 2000 tons of plant produced mix.  Divide into 5 equal \nparts for validation sampling and testing.  \n 502.04.2  Validation:  Report the mean, standard deviation, Quality \nIndex and percent within limits (PWL) of the test results in accordance \nwith the QA manual.   The JMF is considered conditionally validated if the \n\n \n242 \n \n \nfollowing parameters are 71 percent within limits of the JMF and meet the \nspecifications.   \n1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity (G\nmm\n),  \n 2. Percent G\nmm\n at N\ninitial, \n3. Percent passing the No. 8 and No. 200 sieves, \n 4. Percent Air Voids at N\ndesign, \nand\n \n5. VFA.  \n \n The  average  of  all  other  validation  tests  shall  meet  the specifications \nlimits  in  Table  502-6.  The  production  can  continue  during  conditional \nvalidation.  The JMF is considered validated with passing LWT results.  If \nthe LWT fails twice, cease production and re-design.  Upon validation of the \nJMF, the average of the validated results will become the JMF targets. \n 502.04.3  Payment  for Plant Validation:  Payment will  be  in \naccordance with 502.15.  \n The validation mixture is not paid separately, but is considered part of the \nroadway lot.  \n \n502.05 QUALITY  CONTROL AND PLANT  ACCEPTANCE.  All \nquality control information, plant records, etc. will be considered part of the \nDepartment’s  acceptance  decision.  Exercise  quality  control  over  all \nmaterials  and  their  assembly,  design,  processing,  production,  hauling, \nlaydown and associated equipment to ensure compliance with Table 502-4 \nand all other specifications herein. At the end of each production day, notify \nthe District Lab Engineer (DLE) and the DOTD Asphalt District Inspector \n(ADI) of the next scheduled mix production run and placement.   \n For plant quality control, a plant lot, or “P-Lot’ is defined as 1000 tons of \ncontinuously  produced  mixture  from  one  JMF. Obtain a sample of  plant \nmixture and test the mixture once every 1000 tons using a random sampling \napproach. Minimum quality control testing for each P-Lot is as follows:  \n \n  Loose Mix  \n1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity, G\nmm\n \n2. % Asphalt Cement Content \n3. Gradation \n4. % Crushed \n5. Temperature, and  \n6. % Moisture content \n \n\n \n243 \n \n Compacted Specimen, N\ndesign\n \n     1. % G\nmm\n at N\ninitial\n \n     2. % Air Voids, V \n    3. % VMA \n   4.  % VFA, and \n       5. % G\nmm\n at N\nmax  \n(1 per 5 P-Lots)\n \n \nAge  all  loose  mix  tested  for  G\nmm\n or  volumetrics for  one  hour  in \naccordance  with  AASHTO  R30  prior  to  testing.    Age  warm  mix  for  two \nhours.   \nDetermine the rolling five test results average and standard deviation for \naggregate  gradation, asphalt  content,  air  voids,  and G\nmm\n.   Take  corrective \naction or cease production when the latest rolling five test results show:   \n1. Air voids  or G\nmm \nfall\n \nbelow 71 PWL (based on the lastest rolling \nfive test results); or \n2. Average VFA is outside of specification limits; or  \n3. Gradation   for   the   No.   8   and   No.   200   sieve   is outside   of \nspecification limits; or \n4. Asphalt content is ±0.2% the JMF target.  \nEnter  all plant quality control data into the Department’s approved data \nmanagement  system. The  full  range  of  gradation  mix  tolerances  will  be \nallowed even if they fall outside the control points.  The District Laboratory \nEngineer  may  require  re-validation  of  the  mix  when  the  average  of  the \nQuality Control data indicates non-compliance with the specified limits or \ntolerances. \nMeasure  the moisture  content  of  the  cold  feed  aggregates  daily  in \naccordance with DOTD TR 403.  The moisture content of the final mixture, \nmeasured daily, shall not exceed 0.3 percent by weight (mass) when tested \nin accordance with DOTD TR 319. \n    \n502.06   PLANT   INSPECTION   AND   AUDITS.  All Department \ninspection   procedures, including sampling and testing, a n d     t h e \ncontractor’s quality control data form the basis for acceptance of the \nasphalt. The Department’s Certified Asphalt Plant Inspector will randomly \nvisit  and  inspect  asphalt  plants,  sample  and  test  material,  and  review \ndocumentation  to  ensure  conformance  to  specification  requirements. In \nparticular, the inspector will take a minimum of the following samples which \nmay be tested for verification: \n \n\n \n244 \n \n \n Loose Mix  \n  1. Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity, G\nmm,\n \n  2. % Asphalt Cement Content, \n  3. Gradation, and  \n  4. % Crushed  \n \n Compacted Specimen, N\ndesign \n(Using contractor’s equipment) \n  1.  % G\nmm\n at N\ninitial,\n \n  2. % Air Voids, Va, \n  3. % VMA, and \n  4. % VFA. \n \n Compacted Specimen, 7.0 ± 0.5% AV (Using contractor’s equipment) \n  1.  Loaded Wheel Testing (LWT) as needed. \n \nThe  inspector  will  review  contractor  data  and  documentation.    The \ninspector   will   check   the   plant   equipment,   lab   equipment   and   plant \noperations. The inspector will sample asphalt cement working tank and or \ntransport during random plant visits and will obtain random asphalt cement \ntransport samples as requested by the Materials Lab.  \n Lack  of  conformance after  5  P-lots to  specification  requirements  may \nresult in increased sampling, reduced pay, removal and replacement of the \nasphalt  mixture,  decertification  of  the  technician,  and/or  decertification  of \nthe plant. Correct deficiencies or cease operations. \n \n502.07  ROADWAY OPERATIONS. \n 502.07.1 Weather Limitations:  Apply asphalt concrete mixtures on \na dry surface  when  the  ambient  temperature  is above 50°F  for  wearing \ncourses  and  40°F  for  base  and  binder  courses.  Material  in  transit,  or  a \nmaximum of 100 tons in a surge bin or silo used as a surge bin, at the time \nplant  operation  is  discontinued  may  be  placed.  All mixture  placed is \nexpected  to perform  satisfactorily  and  meet  specification  requirements.  \nInclement  weather  will  be  sufficient  reason  to  terminate  or  not  begin \nproduction. \n When base course mixtures are placed in plan thicknesses of 2 3/4 inches \nor greater, disregard temperature limitations provided all other specification \nrequirements  are  met.    When  a  wearing  course  is  substituted  for  a  binder \ncourse mixture, apply the temperature limitation for binder course. \n\n \n245 \n \n 502.07.2 Surface Preparation:  Maintain the surface being covered. \nAcceptance  is  required  for  each  surface  prior  to  placement  of  subsequent \nsurface.  \n Roadway  slope  shall  be  established  at  the  base  course  level  unless \notherwise authorized by the engineer.  The absolute minimum lift thickness \nplaced shall be 1/4 inch greater than the nominal maximum aggregate size \nas shown on Table 502-6.  Failure to meet minimum thickness is subject to \nremoval. \n  502.07.2.1 Cleaning:  Sweep  the  surface  to  be  covered  clean  of \ndust,  dirt,  caked  clay,  caked  material,  vegetation, and  loose  material  by \nrevolving  brooms  or  other  mechanical  sweepers  supplemented  with  hand \nequipment  as  directed.   Remove  excess  joint  filler  from  the  surface  by  an \napproved  method  when  mixtures  are  to  be  placed  on  portland  cement \nconcrete   pavement   or previously overlaid   portland   cement   concrete.  \nRemove  any  existing  raised  pavement  markers  prior  to asphalt concrete \noverlay operations. Payment for removal of pavement markings will be in \naccordance with the applicable item. \n Wash  the  surface with  water  in  addition  to  brooming  when  brooming \nalone does not adequately clean the surface. \n When tack coat is exposed to traffic for more than one (1) calendar day, \nbecomes  contaminated,  or degrades due  to  inclement  weather, reapply the \ntack coat at the initial recommended rate at no direct pay. \n  502.07.2.2  Applying Tack Coat:\n   502.07.2.2.1  Existing   Pavement    Surfaces:  Before \nconstructing each course, apply an approved asphalt tack coat in accordance \nwith"

Do  not  apply AST  if  any  of  the \nfollowing conditions occur:  \n1. Wet or moist surface.  Consider the pavement to be excessively moist \nwhen it is visibly wet or when a one square foot piece of polyethylene \nfilm  condenses  moisture  after  being  tightly  placed  on  the  pavement \nsurface for 15 minutes; \n2. Rain has occurred within 24 hours (for hot applied AST only); \n3. The air temperature or pavement surface temperature in the shade is \nless than 60°F; or \n4. The air temperature is predicted by the National Weather Service to \nfall below 60°F within 24 hours after placement. \n \n507.05  PREPARATION  OF  EXISTING  SURFACE. Potholes  and \nsurface depressions will be repaired by the Department prior to the asphalt \nsurface treatment work unless shown otherwise on the plans.  \nPrepare existing surface at no direct pay unless otherwise specified on the \nplans. Immediately prior to application of the asphalt material, clean and de-\ngrass existing pavements over the full width to be treated.  Remove raised \npavement  markers  at  no  direct  pay.    Sweep  the  pavement  with  a  power \nbroom or blower to remove all loose material.  Clean areas not reached by \nthe power broom or blower by hand brooming or blowing. \n\n  \n292 \n \n \nIf used, ensure that the prime coat or curing membrane, is satisfactorily \ncured  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  Sections  505  and  506  prior  to \napplication of AST.   \nObtain the engineer’s acceptance of  the  surface  prior  to  application  of \nAST. \n \n507.06  APPLICATION. After  the  existing  surface  has  been  properly \nprepared, apply asphalt material and aggregates in the amounts determined \nby the contractor and accepted by the engineer, and in the sequence specified \nherein. \nApply  and  spread  asphalt  surfacing  at  the  temperatures  and  sequences \ngiven  in  Table  507-1  or  507-2.    The  quantities  of  material  given  in  Table \n507-1 or 507-2 may be adjusted by the engineer as field conditions warrant.  \nThe type and condition of the surface being covered will affect the required \napplication rate of asphalt material.  Use the quantities as recommended by \nthe contractor and accepted by the engineer.  Establish the actual rates during \nthe first asphalt and aggregate application. \nBefore  the  asphalt surface  treatment operation  begins,  calibrate and set \nthe  flow  rates  of  the  distributor  and  spray  bar  along  with  the  aggregate \nspreader at a remote location offsite in a manner acceptable to the engineer.  \nAggregate spread rates may be adjusted by the engineer. It should be noted \nthat  after  the  aggregate  spreader  passes,  the  aggregate  should  never  cover \n100 percent of the roadway surface.  The asphalt coated surface should be \nvisible  between  the  aggregates.    Strike  off  aggregate  trucks  at  the  loading \narea for proper material yield measurements. \nThe  aggregate  spreader  shall  follow  immediately  behind  the  asphalt \ndistributor.  Make the initial pass with the rollers immediately following the \naggregate spreader before the emulsion breaks. \n507.06.1 Asphalt Material:  In general, the rate of asphalt is increased \nif the road is absorbent, badly cracked, or coarse, and is decreased if the road \nis  smooth  and  flushed  with  asphalt.    Guidelines  for  adjusting  the  rate  of \nasphalt emulsion in gallons per square yards are shown in Table 507-3. \nDo not allow the length of spread of asphalt material to exceed that which \ncan be covered by aggregate within approximately one minute. \nApply asphalt material at a uniform rate for the full width of treatment \nunless otherwise directed by the engineer.  Keep the application of asphalt \nmaterial  consistently  within  ±0.02  gallons  per  square  yard,  otherwise  stop \nconstruction and recalibrate the distributor to the satisfaction of the engineer.  \n \n\n \n293 \n \nAdjust  the  height  of  the  spray  bar  and  the  angle  of  the  nozzles  so  that \nindividual spray fans do not interfere with each other and uniform double or \ntriple coverage is achieved. Maintain a minimum of 100 gallons of asphalt \nmaterial in the distributor during operation. \nAdjust and maintain one of the special spray nozzles at the ends of the \nspray bar to provide a sharp edge for the asphalt material on the edge of the \nroadway surface being covered.  When the application is less in width than \nthe  length  of  the  spray  bar,  move  these  special  nozzles  to  provide  the \nspecified edge lines. \n When any nozzle becomes blocked during application of asphalt material, \nimmediately  stop  the  flow  of  material  and  clean  the  nozzles.    When  the \nengineer directs that application be made over less than the full width of the \nroadway  at  a  time,  slightly  overlap  adjacent  treatments  longitudinally.  \nOperate the distributor along a marked edge to keep the surface treatment in \nproper alignment. \nTo   secure   uniform   distribution   at   the   transverse   junction   of   two \ntreatments,  stop the distributor  promptly  before  the  flow  decreases.    Place \nbuilding  paper  or  other  suitable  material  over  the  end  of  the  previous \napplication.      Start   the   joining   application   on   the   building   paper.  \nSatisfactorily remove and dispose building paper in accordance with Section \n202 or as directed.  Do not burn building papers. \nDuring   application   of   asphalt   material,   do   not   splatter   adjacent \npavements,  structures,  and  trees  with  asphalt  material.    Do  not  clean  or \ndischarge the distributor into ditches, borrow pits, on shoulders or along the \nright-of-way. \nRemove excess asphalt material at the junction between distributor loads \nor  correct  satisfactorily.  Areas  of  the  surface  to  be  treated,  which  are  not \ncovered with asphalt material directly from the distributor shall be covered \nby means of a hand-held spray attachment equipped with nozzles. \n507.06.2 Aggregates:  Begin   aggregate   spreading   operations \nimmediately   after   the   application   of   the   asphalt   materials.   Place   all \naggregates for hot applications in a surface dry condition.  Apply aggregate \nmaterial  within approximately  one  minute  after  application  of  the  asphalt \nmaterial. \nUniformly spread aggregate over the full width of asphalt material with \none pass of the spreading equipment and with the application being sharply \ndefined  at  edges.    Do  not  drive  equipment  on  uncovered  asphalt  material.  \nWhen necessary to obtain uniform coverage, hand broom the surface.  \n\n  \n294 \n \n \nHand  spreading  will  be  permitted  in  conjunction  with  self-propelled \nspreaders over areas inaccessible to spreaders.  Cover asphalt material with \nthe appropriate rate of aggregate before rolling. \n507.06.3 Multiple  Applications:  When multiple applications are \nto be placed, allow a minimum of 48 hours to elapse between each successive \napplication of emulsions.  Successive hot applications can be placed without \ndelay. \n 507.06.4 Interlayers:  An  interlayer  shall  be  Type  E  as  specified \nherein  and  may  be  placed  on  raw  or  stabilized  base,  on  a  milled  surface, \nbetween lifts of asphalt, or over existing portland cement concrete pavement \nwhich  will  be  overlaid  with  asphalt.  Use  a  liquid  application  rate  that \ncorresponds to the proper aggregate size given in Table 507-1 or 507-2 as \nadjusted by the engineer to meet existing conditions.  Do not place asphalt \nconcrete on an emulsion surface treatment for a minimum of five days after \napplication.  Hot applied interlayers may be overlaid immediately. \n \n507.07  ROLLING  AND  BROOMING  AGGREGATE  MATERIAL.  \nRoll the surface immediately after spreading the aggregate material using a \nminimum  of  three  pneumatic  tire  rollers.    Make  the first  pass  within \napproximately one minute of spreading the aggregate.  Proceed rolling in a \nlongitudinal direction, beginning at the outer edges of the application. \n Make a minimum of three (3) passes over a single point.  Complete all \nrolling within 1/2 hour after aggregate material has been spread. Immediately \ncorrect any deficiencies or damage in the aggregate material detected during \nrolling  and  reroll  as  directed.    Continue  rolling  aggregate  material  until \nuniform  coverage  has  been  obtained.    Roll  the  remaining  applications  as \nspecified for the first application.  Do not use a steel wheel roller.   \n Lightly broom or blow the surface to remove loose material.  Completely \nremove  all  loose  material  from  all  roadway  surfaces,  including  paved \nshoulders.    If  the  engineer  determines  the  amount  of  loose  material  is \nexcessive, pick it up and remove from the project instead of brooming onto \nthe adjacent slopes. \n \n507.08  PROTECTION.  Traffic shall not be allowed on the surface until \nthe aggregate has been placed, rolled, and, if necessary, lightly broomed or \nblown.    For  cold  applications,  lightly  broom  or  blow  each  treatment \nbeginning the next morning, and continue removing loose aggregate up to \nfinal acceptance of the project, if necessary. \nDistribute aggregate material over the surface to absorb any free asphalt, \ncovering any area deficient with aggregate material, and roll as directed at \n\n \n295 \n \nno  direct  pay.    Do  not  displace  embedded  material  during  maintenance. \nWhen  placing  lightweight  aggregate  and  a  dusting  problem occurs,  use  a \nvacuum  sweeper  without  the sweeper  engaged to remove  loose  aggregate.   \nLoose aggregate material will not be permitted on the surface and shall be \npromptly removed. \n \n507.09  MEASUREMENT.   The   quantities   of   asphalt   material   and \naggregate  incorporated  into  the  completed  and  accepted  asphalt  surface \ntreatment  will  be  measured  separately.    Design  quantities  are  based  on \nhorizontal dimensions.  Design quantities will be adjusted when the engineer \nmakes  changes  to  adjust  to  field  conditions.    Each size  aggregate  will  be \nmeasured  by  the  square  yard  per  application.    Asphalt  material  will  be \nmeasured in the distributor by the gallon at application temperatures. \n \n507.10  PAYMENT.  Payment for placement and maintenance of asphalt \nmaterials and aggregates will be made at the contract unit prices, subject to \nthe  payment  adjustment  provisions  of  Section  1002  for  specification \ndeviations  of  asphalt  materials.    The  Materials  and  Testing  Section  will \nprovide the payment adjustment percentage for asphalt materials. Payment \nfor removal of pavement markings will be included in this pay item. \nPayment will be made under: \n \nItem No.      Pay Item   Pay Unit"

Shield steel structural members to prevent weld splatter or arc strikes \nduring form support installation. \n3. Use only in interior bays. \n4. Dead load deflection shall not exceed L/240 or 3/8 inch. \n5. Provide reinforcing chairs which span corrugations and properly support \nthe reinforcing steel. \n6. Metal  chairs  in  contact  with  the  metal  forms  shall  be  hot-dipped \ngalvanized,  electroplated  with  zinc  (GS Grade),  epoxy  coated,  or  stainless \nsteel. \n7.

Inspect forms then saturate with water immediately \nprior to placing concrete. \nStrip forms, inspect, and allow substructure concrete to attain compressive \nstrength of at least 4000 psi prior to placement of superstructure loads. \nPlace  concrete  without  segregating  materials  and  without  displacing \nreinforcement.      Discontinue   operations   if   placement   methods   cause \nsegregation, impede workability, or produce other detrimental effects. \nWhen  placing  operations  involve  dropping  concrete  more  than  5 feet, \ndeposit it through a tremie or other accepted means identified in the concrete \nplacement plan. \nConsolidate   concrete   during   and   immediately   after   depositing   by \nmechanical vibration, subject to the following provisions:Use internal vibration \nunless authorization for other methods is obtained or provided herein. \n1.  Use   vibrators   capable   of   transmitting   vibrations   to   concrete   at \nfrequencies of at least 4500 impulses per minute. \n2.  Vibrate with intensity that visibly affects concrete over a diameter of at \nleast 18 inches.  Vibrate with sufficient duration and intensity to thoroughly \nconsolidate concrete without causing segregation.  Limit vibration at any one \npoint as required to prevent localized areas of grout forming. \n3.  Provide  a  sufficient  number  of  vibrators  to  properly  place  and \nconsolidate each concrete batch. \n\n625 \n \n4.  Manipulate vibrators to thoroughly work concrete around reinforcement \nand embedded fixtures and into corners and angles of forms.  Apply vibration \nat the point of deposit and in the area of freshly deposited concrete.  Insert and \nwithdraw  vibrators  slowly  and  vertically  to  and  from  the concrete.    Apply \nvibrators at points uniformly spaced and which overlap the visibly affected \nzones. \n5.  Do not vibrate directly against reinforcement.  Take special care when \nreinforcement is in sections or layers of concrete which are between initial and \nfinal set. \n6.  Supplement vibration by spading as necessary to ensure smooth surfaces \nand dense concrete along form surfaces, in corners, and locations inaccessible \nto vibrators.  Provide methods in the concrete placement plan. \n7.  Reduce the number and size of trapped air cavities (bug holes) in the \nformed concrete surfaces to minimize finishing. \n8.  Place concrete in horizontal layers no more than 15 inches thick unless \notherwise permitted.  Place and consolidate each layer before the preceding \nlayer has achieved initial set to prevent damage to green concrete and avoid \nplanes of separation between lifts. \n9.  When an emergency results in less than a complete layer being placed in \none operation, terminate placement with a temporary vertical bulkhead.  Prior \nto continuing placement, the quality of the initial placement and the location of \nthe construction joint will be evaluated for acceptance.  Some remediation may \nbe required.  Construction joints are to be in accordance with 805.05.8. \n10. During concrete placements, wash and remove any materials that adhere \nto the surface of adjacent members.  Following concrete placement, remove \naccumulations of mortar splashed on reinforcement steel and forms.  Do not \nmix dried mortar chips and dust in fresh concrete. \n11. Protect any installed projection (reinforcement, anchor bolt, etc.) from \ndisturbance between initial and final set of concrete. \n805.05.2  Reinforced Concrete Box Culvert:  Furnish structures of \neither cast-in-place concrete or precast concrete units.  Install precast units in \naccordance with"

Turn-of-Nut Method Inspection: \nCalibrate a manual job inspection torque wrench in a tension measuring \ndevice.  Install five fastener assemblies of each bolt diameter, length, type, and \ngrade to be used in the work in the tension measuring device and tension to \n\n675 \n \n10 percent  of  MRT  shown  in  Table 807-7.    Further  tension  the  fastener \nassemblies  to  MRT  with  the  job  inspection  torque  wrench  and  record  the \nrespective torque value.  For the five torque values corresponding to MRT, \ndiscard  the  low  and  high  values  and  average  the  remaining  three  values  to \ndetermine the Job Inspection Torque. \nInspect fasteners by applying the job inspection torque wrench to at least \n10 percent  of  the  fasteners,  but  not  less  than  two  fasteners,  selected  by  the \nengineer  at  random  in  each  connection.    If  no  bolt  or  nut  is  turned  by \napplication of the Job Inspection Torque, the connection will be accepted as \nproperly tensioned.  If a bolt or nut is turned by the application of less than the \nJob Inspection Torque, either apply the Job Inspection Torque to all fasteners \nin  the  connection,  or  re-tension  all  fasteners  in  the  connection  using  the \noriginal  installation  method  and  in  accordance  with  the  specified  tension.  \nRepeat the inspection process until the connection is accepted. \n807.05.2.5.3  Calibrated Wrench Method: \nOnly use Calibrated  Wrench  Tightening  when  required  by  the  plans  or \ndirected by  the  engineer.    This  specification  does  not  recognize  standard \ntorques determined from tables or from formulas, which are assumed to relate \ntorque to tension. \n1. Calibrated Wrench Method Pre-Installation Verification: \nSet  wrenches  to  provide  a  tension  not  less  than  105 percent  of  and  not \ngreater than 110 percent of MRT in Table 807-7.  Calibrate the installation \nprocedures at least once each working day for each bolt diameter, length, and \ngrade using the following: \na. The  length  of  air  hose  that  will  be  used during  installation  and  the \nfastener assemblies that are being installed in the work. \nb. Accomplish  calibration  in  a  tension  measuring  device  capable  of \nindicating bolt tension.  Tension three fasteners of the diameter, length, type, \ngrade and washer orientation as those being installed in the work. \nc. Recalibrate  wrenches  when  significant  differences  are  noted  in  the \nsurface condition of the bolts, nuts, bolt/nut threads, or washers. \n2. Calibrated Wrench Method Installation: \nInstall fasteners in all holes of the connection and bring to snug condition.  \nSnug  condition  is  defined  as  the  fastener  tension  that  exists  when  all  joint \nmaterial plies are in firm contact.  This may be attained by a few impacts of an \nimpact wrench or the full effort of a worker using an ordinary spud wrench. \nFurther tension the connection using the calibrated wrench.  Tension all \nfasteners, progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the connection \nto  the  free  edges  in  a  manner  that  will  minimize  relaxation  of  previously \n\n676 \ntightened  fasteners.    Return  the  wrench  to  touch  up  previously  tensioned \nfasteners which may have been relaxed as a result of the subsequent tensioning \nof adjacent fasteners until all fasteners are tensioned to the specified value. \n3. Calibrated Wrench Method Inspection: \nPerform Calibrated Wrench Method Inspection in accordance with Turn-of-\nNut Method Inspection of 807.05.2.5.2. \n807.05.3  Falsework:  Design falsework in accordance with"

For mixtures \nincorporating the Type B or D gradation, if the proportions of the aggregate \nsizes used do not satisfy the gradation requirements of 1003.08.3 due to \nchanges in the gradation, adjust the proportions to bring the combined \naggregates back within specification limits. These minor adjustments for \ngradation will not require a new mix design. Ensure that the mix produced \nis uniform, workable and within the specification limits of Table 901-3. \nWhen plant operations do not produce a uniform and workable mix, cease \nplant operations and take corrective action prior to restart. \nWhen slump, air content, concrete temperature, or gradation \nmeasurements, as plotted on control charts, \nuniform and may fall outside tolerance \nindicate that the mix is not \nlimits, immediately make \nadjustments to keep the mix within specified limits. Failure to make proper \nadjustments or the mix deviates from specification requirements, or the mix \nis obviously defective, the Department will reject the mix. \nDo not change sources of any materials or percentages of cementitious \nmaterials, until a new Mix Design form showing the new material or \nadjusted proportions hasbeen accepted. \n901.06.4 Acceptance and Verification for PCCP Types B \nand D Concrete: Use the Materials Sampling Manual to determine \nsampling and testing requirements for acceptance and verification for \nconcrete for Types B and D pavements, except as follows: \n1.

For purposes of cement material substitution with fly ash and \nslag, do not treat Type IL cement as blended. \nA binary concrete mix is one that combines portland cement and one \nadditional cementitious replacement, e.g., GGBFS or fly ash (class C or F). \nA ternary concrete mix is one that combines portland cement with two \nadditional cementitious replacements, e.g., GGBFS and fly ash (class C or \nF) or fly ash (both class C and F). \nThe maximum substitution rate for binary mixtures is 30 percent fly ash \nor 50 percent GGBFS. \nThe maximum substitution rate for ternary mixtures containing Type I, \nII, III, or 1L portland cement is 70 percent of cement. When using Type IP \nor IS portland cement, the maximum substitution rate for ternary mixtures is \n40 percent. Ternary combinations using both class C and F fly ash are \nallowable. When using fly ash ternary mixtures, replace portland cement \nwith class C and class F fly ash in equal amounts. When using combinations \nof GGBFS and fly ash, the amount of GGBFS must be equal to or greater \nthan the amount of fly ash. \nFor pavement types of concrete (Types B and D), the maximum \nsubstitution rate for ternary mixtures is limited to 50 percent of cement and \nfor binary mixtures is 30 percent fly ash or 50 percent GGBFS. \n921\n8 \n \n\nThe use of Type III portland cement outside of the specified allowances \nfor precast, prestress, and specified HES pavements requires the approval of \nthe Chief Construction Engineer. \n     901.08.3  Chemical Admixtures: Only use admixtures complying \nwith 1011.02, or listed on the Approved Materials List. \nUse an air-entraining admixture in all concrete. Test the total air content \nof the concrete in accordance with DOTD TR 202, and meet the \nrequirements specified in Table 901-3. \nUse set-retarding admixtures in an amount sufficient to produce the \nnecessary retardation. Consider the influence of different materials and job \nconditions, including local weather on setting characteristics. \nInclude the amount of water incorporated in admixtures as a part of \nrequired mixing water. \nFollow manufacturer’s recommendations for adding and mixing high \nrange water reducers (HRWR, superplasticizer) to the mix. \nWhen using multiple admixtures, ensure the same company manufactures \nall the admixtures, and they are all compatible. \n901.08.4 Water: Ensure that the total amount of water in the \nmixture, including admixtures and free water, does not exceed the maximum \nwater- cementitious ratio specified in Table 901-3. Free water includes all \nwater entering the mix with the aggregates, except water absorbed by the \naggregate. \n901.08.5 Aggregates: Ensure that all aggregates for use in \nportland cement concrete meet the requirements of 1003.01. \n901.08.5.1 Fine Aggregates: Ensure that fine aggregates, except \nfor combined gradations for Types B and D, comply with the requirements \nof 1003.08.1. \n901.08.5.2 Coarse Aggregates: Ensure that coarse aggregates, \nexcept for combined gradations for Types B and D, are the grade specified \nin Table 901-3 and comply with the requirements of 1003.08.2. In concrete \nfor bridge decks, use coarse aggregates with a friction rating of I, II, or III in \naccordance with 1003.01.2.4. \n901.08.5.3 Aggregates for Types B and D Gradations: \nEnsure that combined aggregate gradations comply with the requirements of \n1003.08.3. \n901.09 EQUIPMENT.  Provide sufficient plant capacity and transporting \nequipment to ensure delivery at the required rate. Ensure that the rate of \ndelivery provides for proper handling, placing and finishing of concrete and \nmaintains  a  workable  surface.  Ensure  that  methods  of  delivering  and \n922 \n \n\nhandling concrete facilitate placing with a minimum of rehandling and \nwithout damage to the structure or concrete. \n901.09.1 Plant Equipment: Ensure that batch plants include \napproved storage, weigh hoppers, and measuring devices. Properly seal \nand vent equipment to minimize contamination, dusting and loss of material. \nEnsure uniform distribution of the incorporated materials. \nProvide adequate water supply and a device for automatically controlling \nthe amount of water used in each batch. \nProvide communication between the concrete batcher and loader \noperator. \n901.09.1.1 Direct-Fill Elevating Weigh Hoppers: For plants \nusing direct-fill elevating weigh hoppers, use computer controlled lights as \nan indicator of aggregate weights, but not as the sole means of control for \naggregate  proportioning.  Provide  means of control so that, as approaching \nthe quantity desired in the weigh hopper, material may be added slowly and \nshut off with precision. Ensure that weigh hoppers eliminate accumulation of \nmaterials and discharges completely. Make provisions for  removal of \noverloads. \n901.09.1.2 Storage Bins and Silos: For plants with storage bins, \nensure that the bins have adequate separate compartments for each size of \naggregate. Design each compartment to discharge efficiently and freely. \nProvide a means of control so that, as approaching the quantity desired in the \nweigh hopper, material may be added slowly and shut off with precision. \nEnsure that silos are weatherproof, sealed, free of holes, and prevent \ncontamination. Ensure complete separation for each cementitious material. \nDesign silos to freely discharge and equip with vibrators and/or aerators to \nmaintain flow of material and prevent accumulation. Provide silos with a \npositive means of shut off without leaking into the weigh hopper. \n901.09.1.3 Measuring Devices: Equip batch plants to proportion \nmaterials by approved weighing/metering devices. Moisture probes are \nallowed to determine the moisture content of aggregates for batch \nadjustment, provided the accuracy is within 0.5 percent of the results \nobtained by the Certified Concrete Technician in accordance with DOTD TR \n106 and confirmed by the engineer. \nUse separate scale systems: one for aggregates, and another for \ncementitious materials. Weigh each size of aggregate from separate bins \neither individually or cumulatively. Weighing each cementitious material \ncumulatively in the same hopper is allowable but measure the weight of the \ncement first before other cementitious materials. \n923 \n \n\nEnsure  that  weigh  hoppers  eliminate  accumulation  of  materials  and \ndischarge completely. Make provisions for removal of overloads. \nEnsure that scales are accurate to 0.5 percent throughout the range of use. \nMaximum graduation on scales shall be 0.1 percent of the rated scale \ncapacity. When beam type scales are used, ensure that poises are lockable \ninto any position to prevent accidental change of position, and the weigh \nbeam and a telltale device is in view of the operator. Plant measuring devices \nshall be subject to approval by the Department. They shall be tested, \ninspected, and certified every 90-calendar days by a qualified independent \nscale service or the Weights and Measures Division of the Louisiana \nDepartment of Agriculture and Forestry at no direct cost to the Department \nand more frequently when the engineer deems it necessary to assure their \naccuracy. A qualified independent scale service or the Weights and Measures \nDivision of the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry shall \ncertify the plant’s laboratory-measuring devices annually at no direct cost to \nthe Department. \nBatch individual aggregates within 2 percent, and the cumulative total \nweight of aggregates within 1 percent of the required weight. \nEnsure that cementitious materials are within 1 percent of the required \nweight. For smaller batches of 1 to 3 cubic yards, the quantity of cement and \ncumulative quantity of cementitious materials shall be neither less than the \nrequired amount nor more than 4 percent in excess. Cement in standard bags \nneed not be weighed; however, furnish in full bag increments and adjust the \nquantities of other materials accordingly. Do not use bagged fly ash or \nGGBFS. \nMeasure the mixing water by volume or weight. Ensure that water \nmeasuring devices are accurate to 1 percent at 1/2 the maximum allowable \nwater per batch and the maximum graduation is 1 gallon. \nUse approved methods and equipment for adding admixtures into the \nbatch. Measure the quantity of admixtures with an accuracy of 3 percent. \nProvide a separate dispensing device for each admixture. \n901.09.1.4  Batch  Tickets: Certified  concrete  plants  may  be \nequipped with an approved automatic ticket printer system for recording \nrequired batching information. Enter actual weights of material batched each \ntime on the Batch Certification Report or an approved electronic document. \nWhen an automatic ticket printer system is not used, determine quantities \nand batching information by visual observation. The contractor's authorized \nrepresentative shall record these quantities on the Batch Certification Report. \nEnsure that the approved ticket printer system is tamper-proof and prints \ntime of batching, amount of water, batch weights, moisture content of \n924 \n \n\naggregates, and quantities of admixtures. The Certified Concrete Technician \nmay add moisture content of aggregates or quantities of admixtures to the \nprinted ticket when the automatic system does not have these capabilities. \nDuring a printer breakdown, determine quantities by visual observation and \ncertify as stated above. \nEnsure that all records of batches show batch number, day, month, year, \nand time of day to the nearest minute for each batch. Record any added water \non the Batch Certification Report Provide to the engineer, a legible copy of \nall batch records identified with lot number and mix design number. \n901.09.2 Hauling Equipment: \nEnsure that hauling equipment is \nwatertight and capable of discharging concrete at a controlled rate without \nsegregation. \n901.09.2.1 Truck Mixer: Provide revolving-drum truck mixers, \nequipped with tanks for carrying any additional portion of the mixing water \nand capable of dispensing to the nearest gallon. Replace pick-up and throw- \nover blades in the mixing drum when worn beyond the limit recommended \nby the manufacturer. Have available a copy of the manufacturer's design, \nshowing dimensions and arrangements of blades in reference to original \nheight and depth. \nEquip truck mixers with electrically or mechanically actuated revolution \ncounters. Locate counters to provide safe and convenient inspection. \nIn a prominent place, attach to each truck mixer a metal plate on which is \nplainly marked the maximum rated capacity of the drum in terms of concrete \nvolume and rotation speed for both agitating and mixing speeds. \n901.09.2.2 Agitator Hauling Equipment: Furnish agitators with \nblades or paddles to effectively agitate the mix and prevent segregation. \nProvide covers when directed. \nAttach to each agitator in a prominent place, a metal plate on which is \nplainly marked the designed uses for the equipment, the maximum rated \ncapacity in terms of concrete volume, and agitation speed. \n901.09.2.3 Non-Agitator Hauling Equipment: Ensure that the \nbodies of non-agitating hauling equipment are clean, smooth, metal, and \nmortar-tight containers.

Thoroughly mix concrete in a mixer \nof an approved size and type, which will ensure uniform distribution of \nmaterials throughout the mix. \n925 \n \n\nDo not use mixers with worn blades or excessive build-up. Replace pick- \nup and throw-over blades or mixing paddles in the mixing drum or mixing \nunit when worn beyond the limit recommended by the manufacturer. Have \navailable a copy of the manufacturer's design, showing dimensions and \narrangements of blades in reference to original height and depth. \nBegin mixing operations within 15 minutes after addition of cement to \nthe aggregates. When there is an interruption to the mixing operations, \nthoroughly clean the mixer. Remove the entire contents of the mixer from \nthe drum before placing materials for a succeeding batch. Add a portion of \nmixing water in advance of cement and aggregates. Do not use a mixer \nhaving a rated capacity of less than one cubic yard or charge a mixer in \nexcess of its rated capacity. The minimum size batch shall be one cubic yard. \n901.10.1  Central  Plant  and  Site  Mixing: \nMix  concrete  until \nuniformity is achieved but not less than 60 seconds. Mixing time begins after \nall materials are in the mixer. Mixing time ends when the discharge chute \nopens. Ensure that the mixer is equipped with an approved timing device, \nwhich automatically locks the discharge lever when charging the drum and \nreleases it at the end of the mixing period. During mixing, operate the mixer \nat its designed drum speed as shown on the manufacturer's nameplate on the \nmixer. \n901.10.2  Truck  Mixing: \nIn  accordance  with  901.09,  measure \naggregates and cementitious materials for concrete and charge into the drum \nat the proportioning plant. \nEnsure that the size of the batch does not exceed the maximum rated \nmixing capacity as stated by the manufacturer and stamped on a metal plate \non the mixer. When using a truck mixer for complete mixing, mix each batch \nat designated mixing speed until uniformity is achieved, but not less than 70 \nrevolutions. Ensure that all materials, including mixing water, are \nmixer drum before actuating the revolution counter or taking an \nreading. Ensure that any additional revolutions during transit are \ndesignated agitating speed. \nin the \ninitial \nat the \nAdd a minimum of 75 percent of the prescribed amount of batch water at \nthe plant. If the slump is low at the jobsite, add up to the “maximum water \nthat can be added at jobsite” as indicated on the Batch Certification form. \nEnsure that water added at the jobsite does not exceed the maximum \nallowable water-cementitious material ratio or exceed the maximum \nallowable slump by more than 1/4 inch. Reject the load if these criteria are \nexceeded. Add water and/or admixtures at the job site in one or two \nincrements with additional mixing within the range of 20 to 30 revolutions \nat designated mixer speed for each increment. \n926 \n \n\nWhen adding to a partial load, add only a proportional amount of water \nor admixtures. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations when adding \nand mixing admixtures to the mix. \nPerform slump, air, temperature, and unit weight tests, and mold \ncylinders after the addition of all components into the mix. \n901.10.3 Partial Mixing at Central Plant (Shrink Mixing): When \npartially mixing at a central plant, reduce the mixing time to a minimum of \n30 seconds. Complete required mixing in a truck mixer at mixing speed until \nuniformity is achieved but not less than 10 revolutions. \n901.10.4 Time Limitations: Ensure that the maximum time from the \naddition of cement to the mix to final placement of the concrete is 90 minutes \nor a maximum of 300 revolutions, whichever occurs first. When transport is \nby non-agitator truck, ensure that the maximum time from the addition of \ncement to the mix to final \nengineer may reduce the \nconditions contributing to \nconcrete. \nplacement \nmaximum \nrapid  loss \nof the concrete is 45 minutes. The \nallowable  time  for  any  observed \nof  plasticity  or  uniformity  of  the \nFor special applications, the stated time limitations may be modified \nbased on trial batch results. \n901.10.5 Hauling Equipment: Transport fresh concrete in a truck \nmixer, agitator, or other certified equipment. Non-agitator trucks are only \nallowed for pavement concrete. Ensure that the volume of mixed concrete \ntransported in an agitator truck at agitation speed is in accordance with the \nmanufacturer's specified rating. \n901.10.6 Portable Mixing: Obtain written approval from the Chief \nConstruction Engineer to use portable or volumetric mixers for PCCP \npatching and minor structure concrete. \n901.10.7 Delivery: Provide sufficient plant capacity and transporting \nequipment to ensure delivery at the required rate. Ensure that methods and \nrate of delivery and handling of concrete facilitate placement, without \ndamage to the structure or fresh concrete. \n901.11 WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE LIMITATIONS.  Concrete \nused in precast/prestress structural elements may be exempt from the \nfollowing temperature limitations at the determination of the Construction \nFabrication Engineer. \nPrepare for rain and hot or cold weather concrete placement well in \nadvance of these events. \n927 \n \n\nThe contractor is responsible for proper mixing, placing, and curing of all \nconcrete. At no cost to the Department, remove and replace any unacceptable \nconcrete as determined by the Department. \n901.11.1 Cold Weather Limitations: Do not place concrete when \nthe internal temperature of the concrete is below 45°F nor on frozen subgrade \nor into forms that are below 32°F. \n901.11.1.1 PC Mixes: Discontinue concreting operations when a \ndescending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from \nartificial heat, reaches 35°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less \nthan 32°F within the 24-hour period following placement. Do not resume PC \nconcreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the \nshade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 32°F; provided the high \ntemperature forecasted by NOAA is above 35°F and remains above 32°F for \na minimum of 24 hours. \n901.11.1.2 Binary Mixes: Discontinue concreting operations when \na descending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from \nartificial heat, reaches 40°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less \nthan 35°F within the 36-hour period following placement. Do not resume \nconcreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the \nshade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 40°F; provided the high \ntemperature forecasted by NOAA is above 45°F and remains above 40°F for \na minimum of 36 hours. \n901.11.1.3 Ternary Mixes: \nDiscontinue concreting operations \nwhen a descending air temperature at the jobsite, in the shade, and away from \nartificial heat, reaches 45°F or NOAA forecasts the temperature to be less \nthan 40°F within the 48-hour period following placement. Do not resume \nconcreting operations until an ascending air temperature at the jobsite, in the \nshade, and away from artificial heat, reaches 45°F; provided the high \ntemperature forecasted by NOAA is above 50°F and remains above 45°F for \na minimum of 48 hours. \nWritten authorization from the Chief Construction Engineer is required for \nall concrete operations outside these cold weather limitations. \n901.11.2 Hot Weather Limitations: During hot weather concreting, \nit is critical to reduce the evaporation rate from concrete to minimize plastic \nshrinkage cracking by having an appropriate concrete mix design, placement \nmethods, and curing operations. Furthermore, additional moisture loss \nprecautions may be essential when other environmental conditions (i.e. \nrelative humidity, air temperature, and wind velocity) accelerate water \nevaporation from the concrete. \n928 \n \n\nHot weather limitations commence when the internal temperature of the \nconcrete during placement, exceeds 85°F. If these conditions exist, maintain \nan internal concrete placement temperature less than 90ºF or submit concrete \ntrial-batch test results for the concrete mix designs conforming to the \nrequirements for production during hot weather conditions. \nThe hot weather trial-batch acceptance criteria shall meet the following \nrequirements: \n1. Maintain a minimum internal concrete temperature of 94°F throughout \nthe trial-batching process. \n2. After initial mixing, hold the trial batch in the mixer for 90 minutes. \nDuring this period, turn the drum intermittently for 30 seconds every five \nminutes. In between the intermittent turning of the drum, cover the drum \nopening with an impermeable cover to prevent moisture loss and to maintain \nheat. At the end of the 90-minute period, remix the trial batch a minimum of \none minute and then test for slump and air content. \n3. After completion of a 90-minute mixing period, ensure that the trial- \nbatch has the desired workability, with slump and air content within the \nspecified range as shown in Table 901-3. Allow the addition of water if the \nslump is below the target range but do not exceed the maximum water-to- \ncementitious material ratio. Remix a minimum of two minutes after addition \nof second water. Furthermore, ensure that concrete temperature is not less \nthan 94°F at any time during the trial batch testing. \nConcrete placed at a temperature exceeding 90ºF that fails to meet the hot \nweather trial-batch acceptance criteria shall be removed and replaced at no \ncost to the Department. \nThe contractor is responsible for proper mixing, placing, and curing of \nconcrete as determined by the Department. \nRegardless of any hot weather precaution taken, reject all concrete \nattaining an internal temperature in excess of 99ºF during placement. \n901.11.3 Rain Protection: Prior to any concreting operations, have \navailable at the jobsite sufficient plastic sheeting material to prevent \nrainwater from marring or leaving indentations in any fresh concrete. \nLap sections of plastic sheeting a minimum of 18 inches and extend \ncoverage beyond edges so that edges are not marred by falling rainwater. \nSecure plastic sheeting so that it will remain in place to protect the surface. \nAs soon as conditions permit, reapply all curing compound washed away by \nthe rain. Repair all areas of tining or surface finishing marred by rain or \nplastic sheeting coverage. Repair all rain-damaged areas at no cost to the \nDepartment. \n929 \n \n\n901.12 MASS CONCRETE. \n901.12.1  Description: \nMass  concrete  is  defined  as  a  structural \nconcrete placement having a least dimension of 48 inches or greater, or if \ndesignated  on  the  plans or  in  the project  specifications  as being  mass \nconcrete. Structural  Class  S  concrete  is  exempt  from  mass  concrete \nrequirements. \n901.12.2 General: Submit proposals for the mass concrete mix design, \nanalysis, temperature monitoring, and control, including insulation and \nmethods, to the Department for review and acceptance a minimum of 30 days \nprior to the placement of any mass concrete. \n901.12.3 Materials: The structural class designation for mass concrete \nis Class MASS (A1, A2, or A3) as shown in Table 901-3. \n901.12.3.1 Cement/Cementitious Combination: Use Type II \nportland cement. Replace portland cement with fly ash at 20 percent to 50 \npercent by weight or replace with slag cement at 50 percent to 70 percent by \nweight or a ternary mix meeting specification requirements. Certify that the \ncementitious combination generates a heat of hydration of not more than 70 \ncalories/gram at 7 days as determined by ASTM C186 or ASTM C1702. \n901.12.3.2 Aggregates: Use Type B or D aggregate gradation for \nmass concrete. See 1003.08.3. \n901.12.3.3 Admixtures: \nmass concrete. \nDo not use accelerating admixtures in \n901.12.4 Construction: Produce a structure free from thermal cracks. \nPlace mass concrete continuously to eliminate cold joints. \nControl differential temperatures by appropriate use of insulated forms, \ncuring blankets, or other acceptable methods. \nIf during the first 48 hours after placement, the temperature differential \nnears 35ºF, take corrective measures immediately to remain within the limits. \nFurthermore, revise the plan to maintain the limits on differential \ntemperature on any remaining placements of mass concrete. Obtain the \nengineer's acceptance of the revised plan prior to implementation. \nStrength gain and cooling of the mass concrete placements can take a long \ntime. Take all such time and strength considerations into account when \nplanning construction activities. \n901.12.4.1 Analysis and Monitoring: Submit an analysis to the \nengineer of the projected thermal developments within the mass concrete \nelements for the anticipated concrete and ambient temperatures, along with \nthe proposed mix design and construction methods. Include a copy of model \nresults, with site and element specific data, and any electronic files. Describe \nthe measures and procedures intended to maintain, monitor, and control the \n930\n7 \n \n\ntemperature  differential  between  the  interior  and  exterior  of  the  mass \nconcrete elements. A maximum temperature during curing of 160ºF and a \nmaximum differential temperature of 35°F is allowed. An abbreviated \nsubmittal may be allowed for previously approved mass concrete mix \ndesigns. \n901.12.4.2 Monitoring Devices: Provide temperature-monitoring \ndevices to record temperature development between the interior and the \nexterior of the element at points acceptable to the engineer. Monitor a \nminimum of two independent sets of interior and exterior points for each \nelement to provide redundancy. Locate the monitoring points at the \ngeometric center of the element for the interior point and two inches from \nthe surface along the shortest line from the geometric center to the nearest \nsurface of the element for the exterior point. \nMonitoring devices shall be automatic sensing and recording instruments \nthat record information at a maximum interval of one hour. Calibrate \nmonitoring devices to the manufacture’s recommendations. These devices \nshall operate within the temperature range of 0 to 180ºF with an accuracy of \n± 2ºF. Take readings and record the temperature data at intervals no greater \nthan 6 hours to ensure that the automatic devices are working properly and \nthat the temperatures are within allowable limits. The intervals of one and \nsix hours shall begin immediately after casting is  complete and  shall \ncontinue until the maximum temperature differential is reached and begins \nto drop. Transmit these readings to the engineer daily. \nPrior to the placement of mass concrete, perform a test of the automatic \nand manual thermal sensing and recording equipment to ensure they are \noperational. \n901.12.5 Payment for Mass Concrete: Materials, labor, equipment, \nand incidental items associated with mass concrete and controlling the heat \nof hydration are paid for under"
