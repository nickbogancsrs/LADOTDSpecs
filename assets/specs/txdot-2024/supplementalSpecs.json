Pavement temperatures are estimated from air temperatures using an algorithm contained in a Department-supplied computer program, may \nbe provided by the Department, or may be obtained by following procedures outlined in AASHTO M 323 and R 25. \n2. This requirement may be waived at the Department’s discretion if the supplier warrants that the asphalt binder can be adequately pumped, \nmixed, and compacted at temperatures that meet all applicable safety, environmental, and constructability requirements. At test \ntemperatures where the binder is a Newtonian fluid, any suitable standard means of viscosity measurement may be used, including capillary \n(T 201 or T 202) or rotational viscometry (T 316). \n3. Viscosity at 135°C is an indicator of mixing and compaction temperatures that can be expected in the lab and field. High values may indicate \nhigh mixing and compaction temperatures. Additionally, significant variation can occur from batch to batch. Contractors should be aware that \nvariation could significantly impact their mixing and compaction operations. Contractors are therefore responsible for addressing any \nconstructability issues that may arise. \n4. For quality control of unmodified asphalt binder production, measurement of the viscosity of the original asphalt binder may be substituted for \ndynamic shear measurements of G*/sin (δ) at test temperatures where the asphalt is a Newtonian fluid. Any suitable standard means of \nviscosity measurement may be used, including capillary (T 201 or T 202) or rotational (T 316) viscometry. \n5. Max values for unaged and RTFO-aged dynamic shear apply only to materials used as substitute binders, as described in Item 341, “Dense-\nGraded Hot-Mix Asphalt,” and Item 344, “Superpave Mixtures.” \n6. Elastic recovery (D6084) is not required unless MSCR (T 350) is less than the Min % recovery. Elastic recovery will be used for the \nacceptance criteria in this instance. \n7. Silicone beam molds, as described in AASHTO TP 1-93, are acceptable for use. \n8. If creep stiffness is below 300 Mpa, direct tension test is not required. If creep stiffness is between 300 and 600 Mpa, the direct tension \nfailure strain requirement can be used instead of the creep stiffness requirement. The m-value requirement must be satisfied in both cases. \n\n2024 Specifications  300 \n239 \n3.

Stockpiling of LRA. Provide a smooth and well-drained area, cleared of trash, weeds, and grass if storing \nLRA at the project site. Stockpile, handle, and load LRA in a manner that will minimize aggregate \ndegradation and segregation. Avoid contamination and mixing of stockpiles. The Engineer may reject \nstockpiled materials that contact the earth or other objectionable material. \n4.3. Hauling Operations. Transport the LRA mixture to the project or delivery point in trucks or rail cars as \nneeded. Clean all truck beds or rail cars before use to ensure mixture is not contaminated. Use a release \nagent on the Department’s MPL to coat truck beds and inside rail cars when necessary. Waterproof \ntarpaulins are not required to cover loads. \n4.4. Placement Operations. Prepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable \nmaterial such as moisture, dirt, sand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing \nmixture. Remove vegetation from pavement edges. Place the mixture in conformance with the typical section \nrequirements and produce a smooth, finished surface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset \nlongitudinal joints of successive courses of mixture by at least 6 in.    Place mixture so longitudinal joints on the \nsurface course coincide with lane lines, or as directed. Ensure that all finished surfaces will drain properly. \nWhen desired, dump the asphalt mixture in a windrow and then place it in the finishing machine with windrow \npickup equipment unless otherwise shown on the plans. Prevent the windrow pickup equipment from \ncontaminating the mixture. \nDefer compaction after placing the paving mixture as directed to allow for volatilization. Allow the previous \npavement course to dry and cure before placing the next course when placing more than one course. The \ncourse will be considered cured if the hydrocarbon volatile content of the mixture is 0.4% or less by weight of \nthe mixture when tested in accordance with Tex-213-F\n, unless otherwise directed. \nUse a motor grader to spread the mixture when shown on the plans or as approved. Thoroughly aerate the \nmixture and spread into place with a power motor grader in a uniform layer. Placement in narrow strips or \nsmall irregular areas may require hand spreading. \n4.4.1.

The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 and 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per \nsquare yard of surface area. Apply a thin, uniform tack coat to all contact surfaces of curbs, structures, and \njoints. Prevent splattering of the tack coat when placed adjacent to curb, gutter, and structures. Roll the tack \ncoat with a pneumatic-tire roller to remove streaks and other irregular patterns when directed. \n4.5. Compaction. Furnish the type, size, and number of rollers required for compaction, as approved. Furnish at \nleast one medium pneumatic-tire roller (minimum 12-ton weight). Use Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, to establish rolling \npatterns that achieve maximum compaction. Follow the selected rolling pattern unless changes that affect \ncompaction occur in the mixture or placement conditions. Establish a new rolling pattern when such changes \noccur. Compact the pavement to the cross-section of the finished paving mixture in conformance with the \n\n2024 Specifications  330 \n265 \nplans and specifications. Operate vibratory rollers in static mode when not compacting or changing \ndirections, or when the plan depth of the pavement mat is less than 1-1/2 in., unless otherwise directed. \nStart by first rolling the joint with the adjacent pavement and then continue by rolling longitudinally at the \nsides when rolling using the three-wheel, tandem, or vibratory rollers. Proceed toward the center of the \npavement, overlapping on successive trips by at least 1 ft., unless otherwise directed. Make alternate trips of \nthe roller slightly different in length. Begin rolling at the low side and progress toward the high side on \nsuperelevated curves unless otherwise directed. \nAvoid displacement of the mixture. Correct any displacement that may occur to the Engineer’s satisfaction. \nEnsure pavement is fully compacted before allowing rollers to stand on the pavement. Use only water or an \napproved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. Keep \ndiesel, gasoline, oil, grease, and other foreign matter off the mixture. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction with the rollers. The Engineer may require rolling \nusing a trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \n4.6. Irregularities. Immediately take corrective actions if surface irregularities, including segregation, rutting, \nraveling, flushing, fat spots, mat slippage, color, texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, or uncoated \naggregate particles are detected. The Engineer may allow placement to continue for no more than 1 day of \nproduction while the Contractor takes appropriate action. Suspend paving if the problem still exists after that \nday until it is corrected to the Engineer’s satisfaction. \nRemove and replace any mixture that does not bond to the existing pavement or has other surface \nirregularities identified above at the Contractor’s expense and to the Engineer’s satisfaction. \n4.7. Ride Quality. Use Surface Test Type A to evaluate ride quality in accordance with Item 585, “Ride Quality \nfor Pavement Surfaces,” unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nLRA pavement will be measured by the ton of composite LRA pavement of the type used in the completed \nand accepted work in conformance with the plans and specifications. Measure on scales in accordance with \nItem 520, “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.” Keep records on tare weight, gross weight, and net weight \nof the LRA paving mixture for each load of the same type of mixture. The Materials and Tests Division will \nmeasure and report the moisture content in accordance with Tex-212-F\n, Part II, of the LRA paving mixture \nused to determine payment at the plant. All water and light hydrocarbon volatiles in the mixture measured in \naccordance with \nTex-212-F, Part II, in excess of 6.0% by weight at the time of weighing, will be deducted \nfrom the net weight to determine the quantity for payment. \n6.

Use only \nwater or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other compaction equipment unless otherwise \ndirected. Keep diesel, gasoline, oil, grease, and other foreign matter off the mixture. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures, \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction by the rollers. The Engineer may require rolling using \na trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.6. Production Testing and Operational Tolerances. The aggregate gradation and the asphalt binder content \nof the produced mixture must not vary from the JMF by more than the percentage point tolerances shown in \nTable 6. The gradation of the produced mixture may fall outside the master grading limits for any of the sieve \nsizes from 1-1/2 in.   –No. 50 if it is within the JMF tolerances. The aggregate gradation of the No. 200 sieve \nmay not exceed the master gradations shown in Table 4. Any sieve size shown in Table 4 with 100% passing \nrequirements will be allowed a 2% tolerance before the material is considered out of specification. \nThe Engineer may allow alternate methods for determining the asphalt content and aggregate gradation if \nthe aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F does not yield reliable results. Provide evidence to the \nEngineer that results from Tex-236-F are not reliable before an alternate method will be allowed. Use the \napplicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method is allowed. \nCease production if three consecutive tests indicate that the material produced exceeds the tolerances \nshown in Table 6 for any individual sieve or laboratory-molded density until corrective actions are taken and \nthe results approved. Cease production if two consecutive tests indicate that the asphalt binder content \ntolerances shown in Table 6 are exceeded until corrective actions are taken and the results approved. \nCease production if the Hveem stability shown in Table 5 is not met for three consecutive tests until \ncorrective actions are taken and the results approved. \n \nTable 6 \nOperational Tolerances \nProperty \nTest \nMethod \nOperational \nTolerance From \nJMF \nIndividual % retained for sieve sizes smaller than 1-1/2′′ \nand larger than #8 \nTex-200-F \n±5.0 \nIndividual % retained for sieve sizes smaller than #8 ±3.0 \nAsphalt binder content, % Tex-236-F ±0.3 \nLaboratory-molded density, % Tex-207-F ±1.0 \n4.7.

MATERIALS \nFurnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality that meet the requirements of the plans and \nspecifications. \nNotify the Engineer of all material sources and before changing any material source or formulation. The \nEngineer will verify that the specification requirements are met and document all material source changes \nwhen the Contractor makes a source or formulation change. The Engineer may sample and test project \nmaterials anytime during the project to verify specification compliance in accordance with Item 6, “Control of \nMaterials.” \n2.1. Aggregate. Furnish aggregates from sources that conform to the requirements shown in Table 1 and this \nSection. Aggregate requirements in this Section, including those shown in Table 1, may be modified or \neliminated when shown on the plans. Additional aggregate requirements may be specified when shown on \nthe plans. Provide aggregate stockpiles that meet the definitions in this Section for coarse, intermediate, or \nfine aggregate. Aggregate from reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is not required to meet Table 1 \nrequirements unless otherwise shown on the plans. Supply aggregates that meet the definitions in Tex-100-E\n \nfor crushed gravel or crushed stone. The Engineer will designate the plant or the quarry as the sampling \nlocation. Provide samples from materials produced for the project. The Engineer will establish the Surface \nAggregate Classification (SAC) and perform Los Angeles abrasion, magnesium sulfate soundness, and \nMicro-Deval tests. Perform all other aggregate quality tests shown in Table 1. Document all test results in the \nmixture design report. The Engineer may perform tests on independent or split samples to verify Contractor \ntest results. Stockpile aggregates for each source and type separately. Determine aggregate gradations for \nmixture design and production testing based on the washed sieve analysis in accordance with \nTex-200-F, \nPart II. \n2.1.1. Coarse Aggregate. Coarse aggregate stockpiles must have no more than 20% material passing the No. 8 \nsieve. Aggregates from sources listed in the Department’s Bituminous Rated Source Quality Catalog \n(BRSQC) are preapproved for use. Use only the rated values for HMA listed in the BRSQC. Rated values for \nsurface treatment (ST) do not apply to coarse aggregate sources used in HMA. \nFor sources not listed in the Department’s BRSQC: \n build an individual stockpile for each material; \n request the Department test the stockpile for specification compliance;  \n allow 30 calendar days for the Engineer to sample, test, and report results; \n use only when tested and approved; and \n once approved, do not add additional material to the stockpile unless otherwise allowed by the \nEngineer. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n274 \nProvide coarse aggregate with at least the minimum SAC shown on the plans. SAC requirements apply only \nto aggregates used on the surface of travel lanes, unless otherwise shown on the plans. The SAC for \nsources in the Department’s Aggregate Quality Monitoring Program (AQMP) (Tex-499-A\n) is listed in the \nBRSQC. \n2.1.1.1. Blending Class A and Class B Aggregates. Class B aggregate meeting all other requirements shown in \nTable 1 may be blended with a Class A aggregate to meet requirements for Class A materials, unless \notherwise shown on the plans. When blending Class A and Class B aggregates to meet a Class A \nrequirement, ensure that at least 50% by weight, or volume if required, of the material retained on the No. 4 \nsieve comes from the Class A aggregate source, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Blend by volume if \nthe bulk specific gravities of the Class A and Class B aggregates differ by more than 0.300. Coarse \naggregate from RAP and recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) will be considered as Class B aggregate for \nblending purposes. \nThe Engineer may perform tests anytime during production, when the Contractor blends Class A and Class B \naggregates to meet a Class A requirement. The Engineer will use the Department’s mix design template, \nwhen electing to verify conformance, to calculate the percent of Class A aggregate retained on the No. 4 \nsieve by inputting the bin percentages shown from readouts in the control room at the time of production and \nstockpile gradations measured at the time of production. The Engineer may determine the gradations based \non either washed or dry sieve analysis from samples obtained from individual aggregate cold feed bins or \naggregate stockpiles. The Engineer may perform spot checks to verify the percent of Class A aggregate \nretained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer will use the gradations supplied by the Contractor in the mixture \ndesign report as an input for the template. A failing spot check will require confirmation with a stockpile \ngradation determined by the Engineer. \n2.1.1.2. Micro-Deval Abrasion. The Engineer will perform at least one Micro-Deval abrasion test in accordance with \nTex-461-A\n for each coarse aggregate source used in the mixture design that has a rated source soundness \nmagnesium (RSSM) loss value greater than 15 as listed in the BRSQC. The Engineer will perform testing \nbefore the start of production and may perform additional testing anytime during production. The Engineer \nmay obtain the coarse aggregate samples from each coarse aggregate source or may require the Contractor \nto obtain the samples. The Engineer may waive all Micro-Deval testing based on a satisfactory test history of \nthe same aggregate source. \nThe Engineer will estimate the magnesium sulfate soundness loss for each coarse aggregate source, when \ntested, using the following formula: \nMg\nest. \n=\n \n(RSSM)(MD\nact.\n/RSMD) \nwhere: \nMg\nest. \n=   magnesium sulfate soundness loss \nRSSM = rated source soundness magnesium \nMD\nact. \n=   actual Micro-Deval percent loss \nRSMD = rated source Micro-Deval \nWhen the estimated magnesium sulfate soundness loss is greater than the maximum magnesium sulfate \nsoundness loss specified, the coarse aggregate source will not be allowed for use unless otherwise \napproved. The Engineer will consult the Materials and Tests Division, and additional testing may be required \nbefore granting approval. \n2.1.2. Intermediate Aggregate.

Adjust the asphalt binder content or \ngradation to achieve the specified target laboratory-molded density. The asphalt binder content established \nfor JMF2 is not required to be within any tolerance of the optimum asphalt binder content established for \nJMF1; however, mixture produced using JMF2 must meet the VMA requirements for production shown in \nTable 8. If the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt \nbinder content for JMF1, the Engineer may perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F on Lot 1 \nproduction to confirm the indirect tensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. Verify that JMF2 meets the \nmixture requirements shown in Table 4 and Table 5. \n4.4.2.1.15. Mixture Production. Use JMF2 to produce Lot 1 in accordance with Section 341.4.9.3.1.1., “Lot 1 \nPlacement,” after receiving approval for JMF2 and a passing Hamburg wheel result on the trial batch from a \nlaboratory listed on the MPL. Once JMF2 is approved, and without receiving the results from the \nDepartment’s Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch, the Contractor may proceed to Lot 1 production at their \nown risk. \nNotify the Engineer if electing to proceed without Hamburg wheel test results from the trial batch. Note that \nthe Engineer may require up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed \nand replaced at the Contractor’s expense. \n4.4.2.1.16. Development of JMF3. Evaluate the test results from Lot 1, determine the optimum mixture proportions, and \nsubmit as JMF3 for use in Lot 2. \n4.4.2.1.17. JMF Adjustments.

The Engineer will grant full approval of JMF1 and authorize the Contractor to \nproceed with developing JMF2 if the Engineer’s results for the trial batch meet the requirements shown in \nTables 8, 9, and 10. The Engineer will notify the Contractor that an additional trial batch is required if the trial \nbatch does not meet these requirements. \n4.4.2.2.7. Approval of JMF2. The Engineer will approve JMF2 within 1 working day if the mixture meets the \nrequirements shown in Table 5 and Table 8. The asphalt binder content established for JMF2 is not required \nto be within any tolerance of the optimum asphalt binder content established for JMF1; however, mixture \nproduced using JMF2 must meet the VMA requirements shown in Table 8. If the optimum asphalt binder \ncontent for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF1, the Engineer \nmay perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F on Lot 1 production to confirm the indirect \ntensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. \n4.4.2.2.8. Approval of Lot 1 Production. The Engineer will authorize the Contractor to proceed with JMF2 for Lot 1 \nproduction after a passing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch is achieved from a laboratory listed on \nthe MPL. The Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the \nHamburg wheel test on the trial batch. \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s sample from the trial batch fails the Hamburg wheel test, the \nEngineer will suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values. The Engineer \nmay require up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test be removed and replaced at \nthe Contractor’s expense. \n4.4.2.2.9. Approval of JMF3 and Subsequent JMF Changes. JMF3 and subsequent JMF changes are approved if \nthey meet the mixture requirements shown in Table 4 and Table 5, and the master gradation limits shown in \nTable 8, and they are within the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 11. The addition of a WMA \nadditive to facilitate mixing or as a compaction aid does not require a new laboratory mixture design or trial \nbatch. Current JMF changes that exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 in accordance with Table 11 \nmay require a new laboratory mixture design, trial batch, or both. \n4.5. P\nroduction Operations. Perform a new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All source \nchanges for asphalt will require a passing Hamburg wheel test result from a laboratory listed on the MPL. \nThe Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg \nwheel test on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n288 \ntrial batch. Take corrective action and receive approval to proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. Submit a new mix design and perform a new trial batch when the \nasphalt binder content of: \n any RAP stockpile used in the mix is more than 0.5% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport,  or \n RAS stockpile used in the mix is more than 2.0% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials. Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \nItem 300, or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the Engineer with daily records of \nasphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible increments) in accordance with \nItem 320, unless otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a period long enough to affect the quality of the \nmixture, nor in any case longer than 12 hr. unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperatures shown in Table 12. The Department \nwill not pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperatures \nshown in Table 12. \nTable 12 \nMax Production Temperature  \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 64 325\n2 \nPG 70 335\n2 \nPG 76 345\n2 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-\ntemperature grade of the virgin asphalt binder used to \nproduce the mixture.  \n2. The Max production temperature of WMA is 275°F. \nProduce WMA within the target discharge temperature range of 215–275°F when WMA is required. Take \ncorrective action anytime the discharge temperature of the WMA exceeds the target discharge range. The \nEngineer may suspend production operations if the Contractor’s corrective action is not successful at \ncontrolling the production temperature within the target discharge range. Note that when WMA is produced, it \nmay be necessary to adjust burners to ensure complete combustion such that no burner fuel residue remains \nin the mixture. \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all moisture is removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F\n, Part II, and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n4.6. Hauling Operations. Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is not contaminated. Use a \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 341.4.7.3.3., “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations. Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide \nthe Department’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is not used, to measure and record the \ninternal temperature of the mixture as discharged from the truck or material transfer device (MTD) before or \nas the mix enters the paver. Measure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, \nor as approved. Include an approximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n289 \nlocation where the temperature was taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixture meets the temperature \nrequirements shown in Table 12. Calculate the daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift and \nprovide to the Engineer at the end of paving operations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer \nmay suspend production if the Contractor fails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by \nthe end of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt, \nsand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from \npavement edges. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished \nsurface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of hot mix by \nat least 6 in. Place mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6 in. of lane lines, \nare not placed in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as directed. Ensure that \nall finished surfaces will drain properly. Place the mixture at the rate or thickness shown on the plans. The \nEngineer will use the guidelines shown in Table 13 to determine the compacted lift thickness of each layer \nwhen multiple lifts are required. The thickness determined is based on the rate of 110 lb. per square yard for \neach inch of pavement, unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nTable 13 \nCompacted Lift Thickness and Required Core Height \nMixture \nType \nCompacted Lift Thickness Guidelines \nMin Untrimmed Core \nHeight Eligible for Testing \n(in.) \nMin \n(in.) \nMax \n(in.) \nDG-B 2.50 5.00 1.75 \nDG-C 2.00 4.00 1.50 \nDG-D 1.50 3.00 1.25 \nDG-F 1.25 2.50 1.25 \n4.7.1. Weather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a Thermal Imaging System. Place mixture when the roadway surface is dry and the roadway \nsurface temperature is at or above the temperatures shown in Table 14A, unless otherwise approved or as \nshown on the plans. Place mixtures only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway \nsurface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. Provide output data from the thermal imaging system to \ndemonstrate to the Engineer that no recurring severe thermal segregation exists in accordance with \nSection 341.4.7.3.1.2., “Thermal Imaging System.” \nTable 14A \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \n(°F) \nSubsurface Layers Surface Layers \nPG 64 35 40 \nPG 70 45\n2\n 50\n2\n \nPG 76 45\n2\n 50\n2\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin \nasphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \n2. The Contractor may pave at temperatures 10°F lower than these values when a chemical \nWMA additive is used as a compaction aid in the mixture or when using WMA. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or above the temperatures shown in \nTable 14B, unless otherwise approved or as shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature \nusing a handheld thermal camera or infrared thermometer. The Engineer may allow mixture placement to \nbegin before the roadway surface reaches the required temperature if conditions are such that the roadway \nsurface will reach the required temperature within 2 hr. of beginning placement operations. Place mixtures \nonly when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by \nthe Engineer. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n290 \nTable 14B \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \n(°F) \nSubsurface Layers Surface Layers \nPG 64 45 50 \nPG 70 55\n2\n 60\n2\n \nPG 76 60\n2\n 60\n2\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin \nasphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \n2. The Contractor may pave at temperatures 10°F lower than these values when a chemical \nWMA additive is used as a compaction aid in the mixture, when using WMA, or when \nusing a paving process with equipment that eliminates thermal segregation. In suc\nh cases, \nfor each sublot and in the presence of the Engineer, use a handheld thermal camera \noperated in accordance with \nTex-244-F to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer \nthat the uncompacted mat has no more than 10°F of thermal segregation. \n4.7.2. Tack Coat.  \n4.7.2.1. Application. Clean the surface before placing the tack coat. The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 and \n0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. Apply a uniform tack coat at the specified rate \nunless otherwise directed. Apply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular \npatterns. Apply the tack coat to all surfaces that will come in contact with the subsequent HMA placement, \nunless otherwise directed. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in the longitudinal direction during \nplacement of the mat to ensure bond of adjacent mats, unless otherwise directed. Allow adequate time for \nemulsion to break completely before placing any material. Prevent splattering of tack coat when placed \nadjacent to curb, gutter, and structures. Do not dilute emulsified asphalts at the terminal, in the field, or at any \nother location before use, unless required in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendation for \napproved TRAIL product use, or when shown on the plans. \n4.7.2.2. Sampling. The Engineer will obtain at least one sample of the tack coat binder per project per source in \naccordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part III, and test it to verify compliance with Item 300. The Engineer will notify \nthe Contractor when the sampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample from the asphalt \ndistributor immediately before use. Label the can with the corresponding lot    and sublot numbers, producer, \nproducer facility location, grade, district, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if available), and project \ninformation, including highway and control-section-job (CSJ) number. For emulsions, the Engineer may test \nas often as necessary to ensure the residual of the emulsion is greater than or equal to the specification \nrequirement in Item 300. \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperatures shown in Table 15 to establish the minimum \nplacement temperature of the mixture delivered to the paving operation. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n291 \nTable 15 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3,4 \n(°F) \nPG 64  260 \nPG 70 270 \nPG 76 280 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade \nof the virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture.  \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer immediately before entering MTD or \npaver. \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a chemical \nWMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing capabilities, or \npaver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n4. When using WMA, the minimum placement temperature is 215°F. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile. Use a handheld thermal camera or a thermal imaging system to obtain a continuous \nthermal profile in accordance with Tex-244-F\n. Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 341.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.1.1. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.1.1.1. Moderate. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.1.2. Severe. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.2. Thermal Imaging System. Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F\n to the Engineer daily,  unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system.  \nThe Engineer may suspend paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the paving \nprocess to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system.  \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested.  \n4.7.3.1.3. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the thermal images generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 341.4.2., “Reporting \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used.  \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be \npaid for any sublot that contains severe thermal segregation. Evaluate areas with severe thermal segregation \nby performing density profiles in accordance with Section 341.4.9.3.3.3.,   “Segregation (Density Profile).” \nRemove and replace the material in any areas that have severe thermal segregation and a failing result for \nsegregation (density profile),  unless otherwise directed. The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n292 \n4.7.3.2. Windrow Operations. Operate windrow pickup equipment so that when hot mix is placed in windrows, \nsubstantially all the mixture deposited on the roadbed is picked up and loaded into the paver. \n4.7.3.3. Hauling Equipment. Use belly dump, live-bottom, or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except \nfor paving miscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD \nwith remixing capability or when a thermal imaging system is used, unless otherwise approved. \n4.7.3.4. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than \n5   min. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 341.4.9.3.3.5., “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is stopped. \n4.8. Compaction. Compact the pavement uniformly to contain between 3.8% and 8.5% in-place air voids. Take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the operation within 3.8% and 8.5% when the in-place air voids exceed \nthe range of these tolerances. The Engineer will allow paving to resume when the proposed corrective action \nis likely to yield between 3.8% and 8.5% in-place air voids. \nObtain cores in areas placed under exempt production, as directed, at locations determined by the Engineer. \nThe Engineer may test these cores and suspend operations or require removal and replacement if the \nin-place air voids are less than 2.7% or more than 9.9%. Areas defined in Section 341.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas,” are not subject to in-place air void determination. \nFurnish the type, size, and number of rollers necessary to ensure desired compaction. Use additional rollers \nas required to remove any roller marks. Use only water or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and \nother compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. \nUse the control strip method shown in Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, on the first day of production to establish the \nrolling pattern that will produce the desired in-place air voids,  unless otherwise directed. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction using rollers. The Engineer may require rolling using \na trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \nComplete all compaction operations using breakdown rollers before the pavement temperature drops below \n180°F,  unless otherwise allowed. Compaction using a pneumatic or light finish roller operated in static mode \nis allowed for pavement temperatures above 160°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic,  unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan. Payment adjustments for the material will be in accordance with Article 341.6., \n“Payment.” \nSample and test the hot mix on a lot and sublot basis. Suspend production if the production payment factor \nshown in Section 341.6.1., “Production Payment Adjustment Factors,” or the placement payment factor \nshown in Section 341.6.2., “Placement Payment Adjustment Factors,” for two consecutive lots is below \n1.000. Resume production once test results or other information indicates to the satisfaction of the Engineer \nthat the next material produced or placed will result in payment factors of at least 1.000. \n4.9.1. Referee Testing. The Materials and Tests Division is the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if \nthe differences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference in \naccordance with Table 11 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee \ntesting if the Engineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are \nwithin specification limits. Make the request within 5 working days after receiving test results and cores from \nthe Engineer. Referee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the tests in question. \nAllow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to be \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n293 \nreported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if more \nthan three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee test \nresults than the Contractor’s test results. \nThe Materials and Tests Division will determine the laboratory-molded density based on the molded specific \ngravity and the maximum theoretical specific gravity of the referee sample. The in-place air voids will be \ndetermined based on the bulk specific gravity of the cores, as determined by the referee laboratory, and the \nEngineer’s average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. Except for “remove and replace” \nconditions, referee test results are final and will establish payment adjustment factors for the sublot in \nquestion. The Contractor may decline referee testing and accept the Engineer’s test results when the \nplacement payment adjustment factor for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition. Placement \nsublots subject to be removed and replaced will be further evaluated in accordance with Section 341.6.2.2., \n“Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement.” \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot. A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 1,000 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 4,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three–four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 1,000 ton and \n4,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \nIf the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt binder \ncontent for JMF1, the Engineer may perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F on Lot 1 to \nconfirm the indirect tensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. Take corrective action to bring the mixture \nwithin specification compliance if the indirect tensile strength exceeds 200 psi, unless otherwise directed. \n4.9.2.1.1. I\nncomplete Production Lots. If a lot is begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of \nproduction or in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Adjust the \npayment for the incomplete lot in accordance with Section 341.6.1., “Production Payment Adjustment \nFactors.” Close all lots within 5 working days unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. Production Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at \nthe plant in accordance with Tex-2 22-F\n The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain the custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s testing is completed. \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample. At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F\n. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots.  \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample. For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split, and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s “blind” sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample.  \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must ob\ntain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, referee testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n294 \n4.9.2.2.2. Asphalt Binder Sampling. The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt \nbinder for each lot of mixture produced. The Contractor will notify the Engineer when the sampling will occur. \nObtain the sample at approximately the same time the mixture random sample is obtained. Sample from a \nport located immediately upstream from the mixing drum or pug mill and upstream from the introduction of \nany additives in accordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part II. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot \nnumbers, producer name, producer facility, grade, District, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if \navailable), and project information, including highway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain these \nsamples for 1 yr. The Engineer may also obtain independent samples. If obtaining an independent asphalt \nbinder sample and upon request of the Contractor, the Engineer will split a sample of the asphalt binder with \nthe Contractor.  \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of each binder grade and source used. The \nEngineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify compliance with Item 300, \nand will retain the other split sample for 1 yr. \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests shown in Table 16. The \nContractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the Engineer. \nDetermine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 11 for all sublots. \nTake immediate corrective action if the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is less than \n95.0% or greater than 97.0% to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may suspend \noperations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. The Engineer will allow \nproduction to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to yield acceptable results. \nThe Engineer may allow alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide \nevidence that results from Tex-236-F, Part I are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate \nmethod unless otherwise directed. Use the applicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method \nis allowed. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n295 \nTable 16 \nProduction and Placement Testing Frequency \nDescription Test Method \nMin Contractor \nTesting Frequency \nMin Engineer \nTesting Frequency\n \nIndividual % retained on #8 sieve and larger \nTex-200-F \nor \nTex-236-F\n \n1 per sublot 1 per 12 sublots\n1\n \nIndividual % retained on sieves smaller than #8 and \nlarger than #200 \n% passing #200 sieve \nLaboratory-molded density \nTex-207-F \n– 1 per sublot\n1\n \nLaboratory-molded bulk specific gravity \nIn-place air voids \nVMA Tex-204-F \nSegregation (density profile) Tex-207-F, Part V 1 per sublot\n2 \n1 per project \nLongitudinal joint density Tex-207-F, Part VII 1 per sublot\n3 \n1 per project\n \nMoisture content Tex-212-F, Part II When directed 1 per project \nTheoretical maximum specific (Rice) gravity Tex-227-F – 1 per sublot\n1\n \nAsphalt binder content Tex-236-F, Part I 1 per sublot 1 per lot\n1\n \nThermal profile Tex-244-F 1 per sublot\n2\n \n1 per project \nHamburg wheel test Tex-242-F – \nDeleterious in RAS\n4\n Tex-217-F, Part III – \nAsphalt binder sampling and testing\n4,5 \nTex-500-C, Part II – \nTack coat sampling and testing Tex-500-C, Part III – \nBoil test\n6\n Tex-530-C 1 per lot \nShear bond strength test\n7\n \nTex-249-F – \n1. For production defined in Section 341.4.9.4., “Exempt Production,” the Engineer will perform one test per day if \n100 ton or more is produced. For exempt production, no testing is required when < 100 ton is produced. \n2. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer when not using the thermal imaging system, unless otherwise \napproved. \n3. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer. \n4. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or designated laboratory. \n5. Sampling performed by the Contractor. The Engineer will witness sampling and retain the samples for 1 yr. \n6. When shown on the plans. \n7. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or District for informational purposes on a sample obtained \nby the Contractor within the first four lots of the project. \n4.9.2.4. Operational Tolerances. Control the production process within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 11. When production is suspended, the Engineer will allow production to resume when test results or \nother information indicates the next mixture produced will be within the operational tolerances. \n4.9.2.4.1. Gradation. Suspend operation and take corrective action if any aggregate is retained on the maximum sieve \nsize shown in Table 8. A sublot is defined as out of tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s test \nresults are out of operational tolerance. Suspend production when test results for gradation exceed the \noperational tolerances shown in Table 11 for three consecutive sublots on the same sieve or four \nconsecutive sublots on any sieve, unless otherwise directed. The consecutive sublots may be from more \nthan one lot. \n4.9.2.4.2. Asphalt Binder Content. A sublot is defined as out of operational tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the \nContractor’s test results exceed the values shown in Table 11. No production or placement payment \nadjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that is out of operational tolerance for asphalt \nbinder content. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s asphalt \nbinder content deviates from the current JMF by more than 0.5% for any sublot. \n4.9.2.4.3. VMAs. The Engineer will determine the VMA for every sublot. For sublots when the Engineer does not \ndetermine asphalt binder content, the Engineer will use the asphalt binder content results from QC testing \nperformed by the Contractor to determine VMA. \nTake immediate corrective action if the VMA value for any sublot is less than the minimum VMA requirement \nfor production shown in Table 8. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA \nresults on two consecutive sublots are below the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n296 \nTable 8. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that \ndoes not meet the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 8 based on the Engineer’s VMA \ndetermination. \nSuspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA result is more than 0.5% below the \nminimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 8. In addition to suspending production, the \nEngineer may require removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. \n4.9.2.4.4. Hamburg Wheel Test. The Engineer may perform a Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture anytime \nduring production. Suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values when the \nproduction samples fail the Hamburg wheel test criteria shown in Table 10. The Engineer may require up to \nthe entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed and replaced at the \nContractor’s expense. \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture results in a “remove \nand replace” condition, the Contractor may request that the Materials and Tests Division determine the final \ndisposition of the material in question by re-testing the failing material.  \n4.9.2.5. Individual Loads of Hot Mix. The Engineer may reject individual truckloads of hot mix. When a load of hot \nmix is rejected for reasons other than temperature, contamination, or excessive uncoated particles, the \nContractor may request that the rejected load be tested. Make this request within 4 hr. of rejection. The \nEngineer will sample and test the mixture. If test results are within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 11, payment will be made for the load. If test results are not within operational tolerances, no payment \nwill be made for the load. \n4.9.3. Placement Acceptance. \n4.9.3.1. Placement Lot. A placement lot consists of four placement sublots. A placement sublot consists of the area \nplaced during a production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.1. Lot 1 Placement. Placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 for Lot 1 will be in accordance with \nSection 341.6.2., “Placement Payment Adjustment Factors”; however, no placement adjustment less than \n1.000 will be assessed for any sublot placed in Lot 1 when the in-place air voids are greater than or equal to \n2.7% and less than or equal to 9.9%. Remove and replace any sublot with in-place air voids less than 2.7% \nor greater than 9.9%. \n4.9.3.1.2. Incomplete Placement Lots. An incomplete placement lot consists of the area placed as described in \nSection 341.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” excluding areas defined in Section 341.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas.” Placement sampling is required if the random sample plan for production resulted in \na sample being obtained from an incomplete production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.3. Shoulders, Ramps, Etc. Shoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn \nlanes are subject to in-place air void determination and payment adjustments unless shown on the plans as \nnot eligible for in-place air void determination. Intersections may be considered miscellaneous areas when \ndetermined by the Engineer. \n4.9.3.1.4. Miscellaneous Areas. Miscellaneous areas include areas that typically involve significant handwork or \ndiscontinuous paving operations, such as temporary detours, driveways, mailbox turnouts, crossovers, \ngores, spot level-up areas, pavement repair sections less than 300 ft., and other similar areas. Temporary \ndetours are subject to in-place air void determination when shown on the plans. Miscellaneous areas also \ninclude level-ups and thin overlays when the layer thickness shown on the plans is less than the minimum \nuntrimmed core height eligible for testing in accordance with Table 13. The specified layer thickness is based \non the rate of 110 lb. per square yard for each inch of pavement unless another rate is shown on the plans. \nWhen “Level Up” is listed as part of the bid item description, a payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be \nassigned for all placement sublots as described in Article 341.6., “Payment.” Miscellaneous areas are not \neligible for random placement sampling locations. Compact miscellaneous areas in accordance with \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n297 \nSection 341.4.8., “Compaction.” Miscellaneous areas are not subject to in-place air void determination, \nthermal profiles testing, segregation (density profiles), or longitudinal joint density evaluations. \n4.9.3.2. Placement Sampling. The Engineer will select random numbers for all placement sublots at the beginning \nof the project. The Engineer will provide the Contractor with the placement random numbers only \nimmediately after the sublot is completed. Mark the roadway location at the completion of each sublot and \nrecord the station number. Determine one random sample location for each placement sublot in accordance \nwith Tex-225-F.  Adjust the random sample location by no more than necessary to achieve a 2-ft. clearance if \nthe location is within 2 ft. of a joint or pavement edge. \nShoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn lanes are always eligible for \nselection as a random sample location; however, if a random sample location falls on one of these areas and \nthe area is shown on the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination, cores will not be taken for \nthe sublot and a 1.000 pay factor will be assigned to that sublot. \nProvide the equipment and means to obtain and trim roadway cores onsite. Onsite is defined as in close \nproximity to where the cores are taken. Obtain the cores within 1 working day of the time the placement \nsublot is completed, unless otherwise approved. Obtain two 6-in.    diameter cores side-by-side from within 1 ft. \nof the random location provided for the placement sublot. Mark the cores for identification, measure and \nrecord the untrimmed core height, and provide the information to the Engineer. The Engineer will witness the \ncoring operation and measurement of the core thickness. Visually inspect each core and verify that the \ncurrent paving layer is bonded to the underlying layer. Take corrective action if an adequate bond does not \nexist between the current and underlying layer to ensure that an adequate bond will be achieved during \nsubsequent placement operations. \nTrim the cores immediately after obtaining them from the roadway in accordance with Tex-251-F if the core \nheights meet the minimum untrimmed value in accordance with Table 13. Trim the cores onsite in the \npresence of the Engineer. Use a permanent marker or paint pen to record the lot and sublot numbers on \neach core, as well as the designation as Core A or Core B. The Engineer may require additional information \nto be marked on the core and may choose to sign or initial the core. The Engineer will take custody of the \ncores immediately after witnessing the trimming of the cores and will retain custody of the cores until the \nDepartment’s testing is completed. Before turning the trimmed cores over to the Engineer, the Contractor \nmay wrap the trimmed cores or secure them in a manner that will reduce the risk of possible damage \noccurring during transport by the Engineer. After testing, the Engineer will return the cores to the Contractor. \nThe Engineer may have the cores transported back to the Department’s laboratory at the HMA plant via the \nContractor’s haul truck or other designated vehicle. In such cases where the cores will be out of the \nEngineer’s possession during transport, the Engineer will use Department-provided security bags and the \nProtocol for Roadway Core Custody located on the Department’s website to provide a secure means and \nprocess that protect the integrity of the cores during transport. \nDecide whether to include the pair of cores in the air void determination for that sublot if the core height \nbefore trimming is less than the minimum untrimmed value shown in Table 13. Trim the cores in accordance \nwith Tex-251-F\n before delivering to the Engineer if electing to have the cores included in the air void \ndetermination. If electing to not have the cores included in air void determination, inform the Engineer of the \ndecision, and deliver untrimmed cores to the Engineer. The placement pay factor for the sublot will be 1.000 \nif cores will not be included in air void determination. \nInstead of the Contractor trimming the cores onsite immediately after coring, the Engineer and the Contractor \nmay mutually agree to have the trimming operations performed at an alternate location, such as a field \nlaboratory or other similar location. In such cases, the Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately \nafter they are obtained from the roadway and will retain custody of the cores until testing is completed. Either \nthe Department or Contractor representative may perform trimming of the cores. The Engineer will witness all \ntrimming operations in cases where the Contractor representative performs the trimming operation. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n298 \nDry the core holes and tack the sides and bottom immediately after obtaining the cores. Fill the hole with the \nsame type of mixture and properly compact the mixture. Repair core holes using other methods when \napproved. \n4.9.3.3. Placement Testing. Perform placement tests in accordance with Table 16. After the Engineer returns the \ncores, the Contractor may test the cores to verify the Engineer’s test results for in-place air voids. The \nallowable differences between the Contractor’s and Engineer’s test results are shown in Table 11. \n4.9.3.3.1. In-Place Air Voids. The Engineer will measure in-place air voids in accordance with Tex-207-F\n and \nTex-227-F. Before drying to a constant weight, cores may be pre-dried using a CoreDry or similar vacuum \ndevice to remove excess moisture. The Engineer will average the values obtained for all sublots in the \nproduction lot to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity. The Engineer will use the average air \nvoid content for in-place air voids. \nThe Engineer will use the vacuum method to seal the core if required in accordance with Tex-207-F. The \nEngineer will use the test results from the unsealed core to determine the placement payment adjustment \nfactor if the sealed core yields a higher specific gravity than the unsealed core. After determining the in-place \nair void content, the Engineer will return the cores and provide test results to the Contractor. \n4.9.3.3.2. Informational Shear Bond Strength Testing. The Engineer will select one random sublot within the first \nfour lots of the project for shear bond strength testing. Obtain full-depth cores in accordance with Tex-249-F\n \nunless the HMA is being placed directly on concrete pavement. Label the cores with lot and sublot numbers \nand provide to the Engineer. Inspector must use pertinent Department form to document the CSJ number, \nproducer of the tack coat, mix type, and shot rate. The Engineer will ship the cores to the Materials and Tests \nDivision or District laboratory for shear bond strength testing. Results from these tests will not be used for \nspecification compliance.  \n4.9.3.3.3. Segregation (Density Profile). Test for segregation using density profiles in accordance with Tex-207-F, \nPart V. Density profiles are not required and are not applicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nDensity profiles are not applicable in areas described in Section 341.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nPerform at least one density profile per sublot. Perform additional density profiles when any of the following \nconditions occur, unless otherwise approved: \n areas that are identified by either the Contractor or the Engineer with severe thermal segregation,  \n any visibly segregated areas that exist, \n the paver stops due to lack of material being delivered to the paving operations and the temperature of \nthe uncompacted mat before the initial breakdown rolling is less than the temperatures shown in \nTable 17. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n299 \nTable 17 \nMin Uncompacted Mat Temperature Requiring Segregation Profile\n1 \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n2\n \nMin Temperature of Uncompacted Mat Allowed \nBefore Initial Breakdown Rolling\n3,4,5  \n(°F) \nPG 64  <250 \nPG 70 <260 \nPG 76 <270 \n1. Applicable only to paver stops that occur due to lack of material being \ndelivered to the paving operations and when not using a thermal imaging \nsystem. \n2. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of \nthe virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \n3. The surface of the uncompacted mat must be measured using a handheld \nthermal camera or infrared thermometer.  \n4. Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a segregation profile may be \nreduced 20°F if using a chemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD \nwith remixing capabilities, or paver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n5. When using WMA, the Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a \nsegregation profile is 215°F. \nProvide the Engineer with the density profile of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion \nof each lot. Report the results of each density profile in accordance with Section 341.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nThe density profile is considered failing if it exceeds the tolerances shown in Table 18. When a thermal \nimaging system is not used, the Engineer will measure the density profile at least once per project. The \nEngineer’s density profile results will be used when available. The Engineer may require the Contractor to \nremove and replace the area in question if the area fails the density profile and has surface irregularities as \ndefined in Section 341.4.9.3.3.6., “Irregularities.” The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \nInvestigate density profile failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to eliminate \nthe segregation. Suspend production if two consecutive density profiles fail unless otherwise approved. \nResume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \nTable 18 \nSegregation (Density Profile) Acceptance Criteria \nMixture Type \nMax Allowable \nDensity Range \n(highest to lowest, pcf) \nMax Allowable \nDensity Range \n(average to lowest, pcf) \nDG-B 8.0 5.0 \nDG-C, DG-D, and DG-F 6.0 3.0 \n4.9.3.3.4. Longitudinal Joint Density. \n4.9.3.3.4.1. Informational Tests. Perform joint density evaluations while establishing the rolling pattern and verify that \nthe joint density is no more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at or near the center of the mat. Adjust the \nrolling pattern, if needed, to achieve the desired joint density. Perform additional joint density evaluations, at \nleast once per sublot, unless otherwise directed. \n4.9.3.3.4.2. Record Tests. Perform a joint density evaluation for each sublot at each pavement edge that is or will \nbecome a longitudinal joint. Joint density evaluations are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 341.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” Determine the joint density in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, \nPart VII. Record the joint density information and submit results on Department forms to the Engineer. The \nevaluation is considered failing if the joint density is more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at the core \nrandom sample location and the correlated joint density is less than 90.0%. The Engineer will make \nindependent joint density verification at least once per project and may make independent joint density \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n300 \nverifications at the random sample locations. The Engineer’s joint density test results will be used when \navailable. \nProvide the Engineer with the joint density of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion of \neach lot. Report the results of each joint density in accordance with Section 341.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nInvestigate joint density failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to improve the \njoint density. Suspend production if the evaluations on two consecutive sublots fail,  unless otherwise \napproved. Resume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \n4.9.3.3.5. Recovered Asphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The Engineer may take production samples or \ncores from suspect areas of the project to determine recovered asphalt properties. Asphalt binders with an \naging ratio greater than 3.5 do not meet the requirements for recovered asphalt properties and may be \ndeemed defective when tested and evaluated by the Materials and Tests Division. The aging ratio is the DSR \nvalue of the extracted binder divided by the DSR value of the original unaged binder. Obtain DSR values in \naccordance with AASHTO T 315 at the specified high-temperature PG of the asphalt. The Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement of the defective material at the Contractor’s expense. The asphalt binder \nwill be recovered for testing from production samples or cores in accordance with Tex-211-F\n. \n4.9.3.3.6. Irregularities. Identify and correct irregularities,  including segregation, rutting, raveling, flushing, fat spots, \nmat slippage, irregular color, irregular texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, uncoated aggregate \nparticles, or broken aggregate particles. The Engineer may also identify irregularities, and in such cases, the \nEngineer will promptly notify the Contractor. If the Engineer determines that the irregularity will adversely \naffect pavement performance, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace (at the \nContractor’s expense) areas of the pavement that contain irregularities. The Engineer may also require the \nContractor to remove and replace (at the Contractor’s expense) areas where the mixture does not bond to \nthe existing pavement. \nIf irregularities are detected, the Engineer may require the Contractor to immediately suspend operations or \nmay allow the Contractor to continue operations for no more than 1 day while the Contractor is taking \nappropriate corrective action. \n4.9.4. Exempt Production. The mixture may be deemed as exempt production when mutually agreed upon \nbetween the Engineer and the Contractor,  or when shown on the plans. Exempt production may be used for \nthe following conditions. \n Anticipated daily production is less than 500 ton. \n Total production for the project is less than 5,000 ton. \n Pavement repair sections are equal to or greater than 300 ft. For pavement repair sections less than \n300 ft., refer to Section 341.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nExempt production is not eligible for referee testing. For exempt production, the Contractor is relieved of all \nproduction and placement QC and QA sampling and testing requirements, except for coring operations when \nrequired by the Engineer. When mutually agreed upon between the Engineer and the Contractor, production \nsampling will be allowed at the point of delivery. When 100 ton or more per day is produced, the Engineer \nmust perform acceptance tests for production and placement in accordance with Table 16. If the specification \nrequirements listed below are met, the production and placement pay factors are 1.000: \n produce, haul, place, and compact the mixture in compliance with the specification and as directed; \n control mixture production to yield a laboratory-molded density that is within ±1.0% of the target \nlaboratory-molded density as tested by the Engineer; \n compact the mixture in accordance with Section 341.4.8., “Compaction;” \n when a thermal imaging system is not used, the Engineer may perform segregation (density profiles) \nand thermal profiles in accordance with the specification; and \n all other specification requirements. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n301 \n4.9.5. Ride Quality. Measure ride quality in accordance with Item 585, “Ride Quality for Pavement Surfaces,” \nunless otherwise shown on the plans. \n5. MEASUREMENT \n5.1. Dense-Graded HMA.  Hot mix will be measured by the ton of composite hot mix, which includes asphalt, \naggregate, and additives. Measure the weight on scales in accordance with Item 520, “Weighing and \nMeasuring Equipment.” \n5.2. Tack Coat.  Tack coat will be measured at the applied temperature by strapping the tank before and after \nroad application and determining the net volume in gallons from the calibrated distributor. The Engineer will \nwitness all strapping operations for volume determination. All tack, including emulsions, will be measured by \nthe gallon applied. \nThe Engineer may allow the use of a metering device to determine asphalt volume used and application rate \nif the device is accurate within 1.5% of the strapped volume. \n6. PAYMENT \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 341.5.1., “Dense-Graded HMA,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Dense-Graded Hot-Mix \nAsphalt” of the mixture type, SAC, and binder specified. These prices are full compensation for surface \npreparation, materials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 341.5.2., “Tack Coat,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Tack Coat” of the tack coat provided. \nThese prices are full compensation for materials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nPayment adjustments will be applied as determined in accordance with this Item; however, a payment \nadjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned for all placement sublots for level-ups only when “Level Up” is \nlisted as part of the bid item description. A payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to all \nproduction and placement sublots when “Exempt” is listed as part of the bid item description, and all testing \nrequirements are met. \nPayment for each sublot, including applicable payment adjustments greater than 1.000, will be paid only for \nsublots when the Contractor supplies the Engineer with the required documentation for production and \nplacement QC and QA, thermal profiles, segregation density profiles, and longitudinal joint densities in \naccordance with Section 341.4.2., “Reporting and Responsibilities.” When a thermal imaging system is used, \ndocumentation is not required for segregation density profiles on individual sublots; however, the thermal \nimaging system automated reports described in Tex-244-F\n are required. \nTrial batches will not be paid for unless they are included in pavement work approved by the Department. \nPayment adjustment for ride quality will be determined in accordance with Item 585. \n6.1. Production Payment Adjustment Factors. The production payment adjustment factor is based on the \nlaboratory-molded density using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk specific gravities of the samples from \neach sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s maximum theoretical specific gravity for the sublot. The \nindividual sample densities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the production payment adjustment \nfactor in accordance with Table 19 for each sublot, using the deviation from the target laboratory-molded \ndensity in accordance with Table 9. The production payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the \naverage of the payment adjustment factors for the four sublots sampled within that lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n302 \nTable 19 \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factors for Laboratory-Molded Density\n1\n \nAbsolute Deviation from \nTarget Laboratory-Molded Density \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factor \n(Target Laboratory-Molded Density) \n0.0 1.050 \n0.1 1.050 \n0.2 1.050 \n0.3 1.044 \n0.4 1.038 \n0.5 1.031 \n0.6 1.025 \n0.7 1.019 \n0.8 1.013 \n0.9 1.006 \n1.0 1.000 \n1.1 0.965 \n1.2 0.930 \n1.3 0.895 \n1.4 0.860 \n1.5 0.825 \n1.6 0.790 \n1.7 0.755 \n1.8 0.720 \n>1.8 Remove and replace \n1. If the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is <95.0% or >97.0%, take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may \nsuspend operations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. \nThe Engineer will allow production to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely \nto yield acceptable results. \n6.1.1. Payment for Incomplete Production Lots. Production payment adjustments for incomplete lots, described \nunder Section 341.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” will be calculated using the average production \npayment factors from all sublots sampled.  \nA production payment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot when the random sampling plan did not \nresult in collection of any samples within the first sublot. \n6.1.2. Production Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the laboratory-molded \ndensity for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as shown in Table 19, the Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer \nmay also accept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized \nWork.” Replacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in accordance with this \nSection. \n6.2. Placement Payment Adjustment Factors. The placement payment adjustment factor is based on in-place \nair voids using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk specific gravities of the cores from each sublot will be \ndivided by the Engineer’s average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. The individual core \ndensities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the placement payment adjustment factor in \naccordance with Table 20 for each sublot that requires in-place air void measurement. A placement payment \nadjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to the entire sublot when the random sample location falls in an \narea shown on the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination. A placement payment adjustment \nfactor of 1.000 will be assigned to quantities placed in areas described in Section 341.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas.” The placement payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the average of \nthe placement payment adjustment factors for up to four sublots within that lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n303 \nTable 20 \nPlacement Payment Adjustment Factors for In-Place Air Voids \nIn-Place \nAir Voids \nPlacement Pay \nAdjustment Factor \nIn-Place \nAir Voids \nPlacement Payment \nAdjustment Factor \n<2.7 Remove and replace 6.4 1.042 \n2.7 0.710 6.5 1.040 \n2.8 0.740 6.6 1.038 \n2.9 0.770 6.7 1.036 \n3.0 0.800 6.8 1.034 \n3.1 0.830 6.9 1.032 \n3.2 0.860 7.0 1.030 \n3.3 0.890 7.1 1.028 \n3.4 0.920 7.2 1.026 \n3.5 0.950 7.3 1.024 \n3.6 0.980 7.4 1.022 \n3.7 0.998 7.5 1.020 \n3.8 1.002 7.6 1.018 \n3.9 1.006 7.7 1.016 \n4.0 1.010 7.8 1.014 \n4.1 1.014 7.9 1.012 \n4.2 1.018 8.0 1.010 \n4.3 1.022 8.1 1.008 \n4.4 1.026 8.2 1.006 \n4.5 1.030 8.3 1.004 \n4.6 1.034 8.4 1.002 \n4.7 1.038 8.5 1.000 \n4.8 1.042 8.6 0.998 \n4.9 1.046 8.7 0.996 \n5.0 1.050 8.8 0.994 \n5.1 1.050 8.9 0.992 \n5.2 1.050 9.0 0.990 \n5.3 1.050 9.1 0.960 \n5.4 1.050 9.2 0.930 \n5.5 1.050 9.3 0.900 \n5.6 1.050 9.4 0.870 \n5.7 1.050 9.5 0.840 \n5.8 1.050 9.6 0.810 \n5.9 1.050 9.7 0.780 \n6.0 1.050 9.8 0.750 \n6.1 1.048 9.9 0.720 \n6.2 1.046 >9.9 Remove and replace \n6.3 1.044 – – \n6.2.1. Payment for Incomplete Placement Lots. Payment adjustments for incomplete placement lots described \nunder Section 341.4.9.3.1.2., “Incomplete Placement Lots,” will be calculated using the average of the \nplacement payment factors from all sublots sampled and sublots where the random location falls in an area \nshown on the plans as not eligible for in-place air void determination.  \nIf the random sampling plan results in production samples, but not in placement samples, the random core \nlocation and placement adjustment factor for the sublot will be determined by applying the placement random \nnumber to the length of the sublot placed. \nIf the random sampling plan results in placement samples, but not in production samples, no placement \nadjustment factor will apply for that sublot placed. \nA placement payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot when the random sampling plan \ndid not result in collection of any production samples. \n6.2.2. Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the placement payment \nadjustment factor for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as shown in Table 20, the \n\n2024 Specifications  341 \n304 \nEngineer will choose the location of two cores to be taken within 3 ft. of the original failing core location. The \nContractor must obtain the cores in the presence of the Engineer. The Engineer will take immediate \npossession of the untrimmed cores and submit the untrimmed cores to the Materials and Tests Division, \nwhere they will be trimmed, if necessary, and tested for bulk specific gravity within 10 working days of \nreceipt. \nThe bulk specific gravity of each core from each sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s average maximum \ntheoretical specific gravity for the lot. The individual core densities for the sublot will be averaged to \ndetermine the new payment adjustment factor of the sublot in question. If the new payment adjustment factor \nis 0.720 or greater, the new payment adjustment factor will apply to that sublot. If the new payment \nadjustment factor is less than 0.720, no payment will be made for the sublot. Remove and replace the failing \nsublot, or the Engineer may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer may also \naccept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized Work.” \nReplacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in accordance with this Section. \n6.3.

DESCRIPTION \nConstruct a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) surface course composed of a compacted permeable mixture of \naggregate, asphalt binder, and additives mixed hot in a mixing plant. \n2. MATERIALS \nFurnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality that meet the requirements of the plans and \nspecifications. \nNotify the Engineer of all material sources and before changing any material source or formulation. The \nEngineer will verify that the specification requirements are met and document all material source changes \nwhen the Contractor makes a source or formulation change. The Engineer may sample and test project \nmaterials anytime during the project to verify specification compliance in accordance with Item 6, “Control of \nMaterials.” \n2.1. Aggregate.  Furnish aggregates from sources that conform to the requirements shown in Table 1 and this \nSection. Aggregate requirements in this Section, including those shown in Table 1, may be\n modified or \neliminated when shown on the plans. Additional aggregate requirements may be specified when\n shown on \nthe plans. Provide aggregate stockpiles that meet the definitions in this Section for coarse\n aggregate. Do not \nuse intermediate or fine aggregate in permeable friction course (PFC) mixtures. Supply aggregates that meet \nthe definitions in Tex-100-E\n for crushed gravel or crushed stone.  T  he Engineer will designate the plant or the \nquarry as the sampling location. Provide samples from materials  produced for the project. The Engineer will \nestablish the Surface Aggregate Classification (SAC) and perform Los Angeles abrasion, magnesium sulfate \nsoundness, and Micro-Deval tests. Perform all other\n aggregate quality tests in accordance with Table 1. \nDocument all test results in the mixture design report. The Engineer\n may perform tests on independent or split \nsamples to verify Contractor test results. Stockpile aggregates for\n each source and type separately. \nDetermine aggregate gradations for mixture design and production testing\n based on the washed sieve \nanalysis in accordance with \nTex-200-F,  Part II.   \n2.1.1. Coarse Aggregate.  Coarse aggregate stockpiles must have no more than 20% material passing the No. 8 \nsieve. Aggregates from sources listed in the Department’s Bituminous Rated Source Quality Catalog \n(BRSQC)  are preapproved for use. Use only the rated values for HMA listed in the BRSQC. Rated values for \nsurface treatment do not apply to coarse aggregate sources used in HMA. \nFor sources not listed in the Department’s BRSQC: \n build an individual stockpile for each material; \n request the Department test the stockpile for specification compliance; \n allow 30 calendar days for the Engineer to sample, test, and report results; \n use only when tested and approved; and \n once approved, do not add additional material to the stockpile unless otherwise allowed by the \nEngineer. \nProvide coarse aggregate with at least the minimum SAC shown on the plans. SAC requirements apply only \nto aggregates used on the surface of travel lanes, unless otherwise shown on the plans. The SAC for \nsources in the Department’s Aggregate Quality Monitoring Program (AQMP) (Tex-499-A\n) is listed in the \nBRSQC. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n306 \n2.1.1.1. Blending Class A and Class B Aggregates. To prevent crushing of the Class B aggregate when blending, \nClass B aggregate may be blended with a    Class A aggregate to meet requirements for Class A materials if: \n the Department’s BRSQC rated source soundness magnesium (RSSM) rating for the Class B aggregate \nis less than the Class A aggregate, or \n the RSSM rating for the Class B aggregate is no more than 10% of the RSSM rating for the Class A \naggregate. \nWhen blending Class A and Class B aggregates to meet a Class A requirement, ensure that at least 50% by \nweight, or volume if required, of the material retained on the No. 4 sieve comes from the Class A aggregate \nsource, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Blend by volume if the bulk-specific gravities of the Class A \nand Class B aggregates differ by more than 0.300. Class B aggregate may be disallowed when shown on the \nplans. \nThe Engineer may perform tests anytime during production, when the Contractor blends Class A and Class B \naggregates to meet a Class A requirement. The Engineer will use the Department’s mix design template, \nwhen electing to verify conformance, to calculate the percent of Class A aggregate retained on the No. 4 \nsieve by inputting the bin percentages shown from readouts in the control room at the time of production and \nstockpile gradations measured at the time of production. The Engineer may determine the gradations based \non either washed or dry sieve analysis from samples obtained from individual aggregate cold feed bins or \naggregate stockpiles. The Engineer may perform spot checks to verify the percent of Class A aggregate \nretained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer will use the gradations supplied by the Contractor in the mixture \ndesign report as an input for the template. A failing spot check will require confirmation with a stockpile \ngradation determined by the Engineer. \n2.1.1.2. Micro-Deval Abrasion.  The Engineer will perform at least one Micro-Deval abrasion test in accordance with \nTex-461-A\n for each coarse aggregate source used in the mixture design that has an RSSM loss value greater \nthan 10 as listed in the BRSQC, unless otherwise directed. The Engineer will perform  testing before the start \nof production and may perform additional testing anytime during production. The Engineer may obtain the \ncoarse aggregate samples from each coarse aggregate source or may require the Contractor to obtain the \nsamples. The Engineer may waive all Micro-Deval testing based on a  satisfactory test history of the same \naggregate source. \nThe Engineer will estimate the magnesium sulfate soundness loss for each coarse aggregate source, when \ntested, using the following formula. \nMg\nest. \n=\n \n(RSSM)(MD\nact.\n/RSMD) \nwhere: \nMg\nest. \n= magnesium sulfate soundness loss \nRSSM = rated source soundness magnesium \nMD\nact. \n= actual Micro-Deval percent loss \nRSMD = rated source Micro-Deval \nWhen the estimated magnesium sulfate soundness loss is greater than the maximum magnesium sulfate\n \nsoundness loss specified, the coarse aggregate source will not be allowed for use unless otherwise \napproved. The Engineer will consult the Materials and Tests Division, and additional testing may be required \nbefore granting approval. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n307 \nTable 1 \nCoarse Aggregate Quality Requirements \nProperty Test Method Requirement \nSAC Tex-499-A (AQMP) As shown on the plans \nDeleterious material, %, Max Tex-217-F, Part I 1.0 \nDecantation, %, Max Tex-217-F, Part II 1.5 \nMicro-Deval abrasion, % Tex-461-A Note \n1\n \nLos Angeles abrasion, %, Max Tex-410-A 30 \nMagnesium sulfate soundness, 5 cycles, %, Max Tex-411-A 20 \nCrushed face count,\n2 \n%, Min Tex-460-A, Part I 95 \nFlat and elongated particles @ 5:1, %, Max Tex-280-F 10 \n1.

Use \na   Department-approved laboratory listed on the MPL to perform the Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch \nmixture,  or request that the Department perform the Hamburg wheel test. Provide approximately 25 lb.    of the \ntrial batch\n mixture if opting to have the Department perform the Hamburg wheel test, if  applicable, and request \nthat the Department perform the test. Upon receiving the sample from the Contractor, the Engineer will be \nallowed 10 working days to provide the Contractor with Hamburg wheel test results on the trial batch. Provide \nthe Engineer with a    copy of the trial batch test results. \n4.4.2.1.14. Development of JMF2. After the Engineer grants full approval of JMF1, evaluate the trial batch test results, \ndetermine the target mixture proportions, and\n submit as JMF2. The mixture produced using JMF2 must \nmeet the requirements shown in Table 4 and Table 5. Verify\n that JMF2 meets the operational tolerances \nshown in Table 6. \n4.4.2.1.15. Mixture Production. Use JMF2 to produce Lot 1 after receiving approval for JMF2 and, if pertinent, a \npassing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch from a laboratory listed on the MPL. Once JMF2 is \napproved, and without receiving the results from the Department’s Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch, the \nContractor may proceed to Lot 1 production at their own risk. \n4.4.2.1.16. Development of JMF3. Evaluate the test results from Lot 1, determine the optimum mixture proportions, and \nsubmit as JMF3 for use in Lot 2. \n4.4.2.1.17. JMF Adjustments.  If   JMF adjustments are necessary to achieve the specified requirements, make the\n \nadjustments before beginning a new lot. The adjusted JMF must: \n be provided to the Engineer in writing before the start of a new lot, \n be numbered in sequence to the previous JMF, \n meet the master gradation limits in accordance with Table 4, \n meet the binder content limits in accordance with Table 5, and \n be within the operational tolerances of JMF2 listed in accordance with Table 6. \n4.4.2.1.18. Requesting Referee Testing.  Use referee testing, if needed, in accordance with Section 342.4.9.1.,\n “Referee \nTesting,” to resolve testing differences with the Engineer. \n \nTable 6 \nOperational Tolerances \nDescription Test Method \nAllowable Difference \nbetween JMF2 and \nJMF1 Target\n1\n \nAllowable Difference \nBetween Current \nJMF and JMF2\n2\n \nAllowable Difference \nBetween Contractor \nand Engineer\n3\n \nIndividual % retained on sieves \nlarger than #200 \nTex-200-F \nor \nTex-236-F\n \nMust be within master \ngradation limits in \nTable 4 \n±3.0\n4\n \n±5.0 \n% passing the #200 sieve ±2.0 \nLaboratory-molded density, % Tex-207-F, Part VIII ±1.0 ±1.0 ±1.0 \nAsphalt binder content,\n5,6\n % Tex-236-F, Part I ±0.3\n7\n ±0.3\n7\n ±0.3 \n1. JMF1 is the approved laboratory mixture design used for producing the trial batch. JMF2 is the approved mixture design \ndeveloped from the trial batch used to produce Lot 1. \n2. Current JMF is JMF3 or higher. JMF3 is the approved mixture design used to produce Lot 2. \n3. Contractor may request referee testing when values exceed these tolerances. \n4. Aggregate   gradation is not allowed to be outside the limits shown in Table 4.    \n5. Ensure the binder content determination excludes fibers. \n6. May be obtained from asphalt mass flow meter readouts as determined by the Engineer. \n7. Binder content is not allowed to be outside the limits shown in Table 5. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n315 \n4.4.2.2. Engineer’s Responsibilities. \n4.4.2.2.1. Superpave Gyratory Compactor.  The Engineer will use a Department SGC, calibrated in accordance with \nTex-241-F\n, to mold samples for laboratory mixture design verification. For molding trial batch and production \nspecimens, the Engineer will use the Contractor-provided SGC at the field laboratory or provide and use a \nDepartment\n SGC at an alternate location. \n4.4.2.2.2. Conditional Approval of JMF1 and Authorizing Trial Batch. The Engineer will review and verify \nconformance with the following information within 2    working days of receipt.: \n the Contractor’s mix design report (JMF1); \n the Contractor-provided Hamburg wheel test results, if applicable; \n all required materials including aggregates, asphalt, and additives; and \n the mixture specifications. \nThe Engineer will grant the Contractor conditional approval of JMF1 if the information provided on the paper \ncopy of JMF1 indicates that the Contractor’s mixture design meets the specifications. When the Contractor \ndoes not provide Hamburg wheel test results with laboratory mixture design, 10 working days are allowed for \nconditional approval of JMF1. The Engineer will base full approval of JMF1 on the test results on mixture \nfrom the trial batch. \nUnless waived, the Engineer will determine the Micro-Deval abrasion loss in accordance with \nSection 342.2.1.1.2., “Micro-Deval Abrasion.” If the Engineer’s test results are pending after 2 working days, \nconditional approval of JMF1 will still be granted within 2 working days of receiving JMF1. When the \nEngineer’s test results become available, they will be used for specification compliance. \nThe Contractor is authorized to produce a trial batch after the Engineer grants conditional approval of JMF1. \n4.4.2.2.3. Hamburg Wheel Testing of JMF1.  If the Contractor requests the option to have the Department perform the \nHamburg wheel test on the laboratory mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in accordance with Tex-242-F\n to \nverify compliance with the Hamburg wheel test requirement shown in Table 5. Upon receiving the sample \nfrom the Contractor, the Engineer will be\n allowed 10 working days to provide the Contractor with Hamburg \nwheel test results on the\n laboratory mixture design. \n4.4.2.2.4. Ignition Oven Correction Factors.  The Engineer will determine ignition oven correction factors by one of the \nfollowing options. \n Witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples by the Contractor in accordance with \nTex-236-F\n, Part III. The Engineer will use the identically prepared samples provided by the Contractor to \ndetermine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in accordance with \nTex-236-F, Part II. \n If the Engineer does not witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples, the Engineer will \nprepare the samples to determine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in \naccordance Tex-236-F, Part II. Notify the Contractor before performing Tex-236-F\n,  Part II. Allow the \nContractor to witness the Engineer performing Tex-236-F,  Part II. \nCorrection factors must be performed every 12 mo. to be used for QA testing during production. \n4.4.2.2.5. Testing the Trial Batch.  Within 1    full working day, the Engineer will sample and test the trial batch to ensure\n \nthat the mixture meets the requirements shown Table 6. If the Contractor requests the option to have the \nDepartment perform the Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in \naccordance with Tex-242-F to verify compliance with the Hamburg wheel test requirement shown in Table 5. \nThe Engineer will have the option to perform Tex-530-C on the trial batch when shown on the plans. These \nresults may be retained and used for comparison purposes during production. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n316 \n4.4.2.2.6. Full Approval of JMF1. The Engineer will grant full approval of JMF1 and authorize the Contractor to\n \nproceed with developing JMF2 if the Engineer’s results for the trial batch meet the requirements shown in \nTables 4, 5, and 6. The Engineer will notify the Contractor that an additional trial batch is required if the trial \nbatch does not meet\n these requirements. \n4.4.2.2.7. Approval of JMF2. The Engineer will approve JMF2 within 1    working day if the mixture meets the \nrequirements shown in  Tables 4, 5, and 6. \n4.4.2.2.8. Approval of Lot 1    Production. The Engineer will authorize the Contractor to proceed with JMF2 for Lot 1 \nproduction after a passing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch is achieved from a laboratory listed on \nthe MPL. The Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the \nHamburg wheel test on the trial batch. \n4.4.2.2.9. Approval of JMF3 and Subsequent JMF Changes. JMF3 and subsequent JMF changes are approved if\n \nthey meet the master gradation limits shown in Table 4, the asphalt binder content shown in Table 5, and they \nare within the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 6. The addition of a warm-mix asphalt (WMA) \nadditive to facilitate mixing or as a compaction aid does not require a new laboratory mixture design or trial \nbatch. Current JMF changes that exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 6 may require a \nnew laboratory mixture design, trial batch, or both. \n4.4.2.2.10. Binder Content Adjustments.  For JMF2 and above, the Engineer may require the Contractor to adjust the\n \ntarget binder content by no more than 0.3% from the current JMF. \n4.5. Production Operations.  Perform a    new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All source \nchanges for asphalt will require a passing Hamburg wheel test result from a laboratory listed on the MPL.  The \nContractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg wheel \ntest on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and trial \nbatch. Take corrective action and receive approval to\n proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials. Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \nItem 300, or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the\n Engineer with daily records of \nasphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible increments) in accordance with \nItem 320, unless\n otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a    period long enough to affect the quality of the \nmixture, nor in\n any case longer than 12 hr. unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce\n \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperatures shown in Table 7. The Department will \nnot pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperatures shown in \nTable 7. \nTable 7 \nMax Production Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 76 345 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the \nhigh-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt binder used to \nproduce the mixture.  \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all    moisture is   removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F,  Part II,    and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n317 \n4.6. Hauling Operations. Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is not contaminated. Use a\n \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 342.4.7.3.3., “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling\n \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations. Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide the \nDepartment’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a handheld thermal camera \nor infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is not used, to measure and record the internal \ntemperature of the mixture immediately before the mix enters the material transfer device (MTD) or paver. \nMeasure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, or as approved. Include an \napproximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the location where the temperature \nwas taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixture meets the temperature requirement shown in Table 7. Calculate \nthe  daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift    and provide to the Engineer at the end of paving\n \noperations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer may suspend production if the Contractor \nfails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by the end of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt,\n \nsand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from \npavement edges. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished \nsurface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of hot-mix by \nat least 6-in.    Place mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6-in. of lane lines, \nare not placed in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as\n directed. Ensure that \nall finished surfaces will drain properly. \n4.7.1. Weather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a Thermal Imaging System. Place mixture when the roadway surface is dry and the\n roadway \nsurface temperature is at or above 60°F, unless otherwise approved or as shown on the plans. Place mixtures \nonly when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by the \nEngineer. Provide output data from the\n thermal imaging system to demonstrate to the Engineer that no \nrecurring severe thermal segregation exists in  accordance with Section 342.4.7.3.1.2., “Thermal Imaging \nSystem.” \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to facilitate \ncompaction when the\n air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or\n above 70°F, unless otherwise approved \nor as shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature\n using a handheld thermal camera or \ninfrared thermometer. Place mixtures\n only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway \nsurface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. The Engineer may restrict the Contractor from paving if \nthe air temperature is 60°F and falling. \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to facilitate \ncompaction when the\n air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.2. Tack Coat. \n4.7.2.1. Application. Clean the surface before placing the tack coat. The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 gal. \nand 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. Apply a uniform tack coat at the specified \nrate unless otherwise directed. Apply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular \npatterns. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in the longitudinal direction during placement of the mat to \nensure bond of adjacent PFC mats, unless otherwise directed. Unless otherwise directed, avoid tacking the \nvertical faces of adjacent PFC mats in the longitudinal direction to avoid restricting lateral drainage. Apply \ntack coat to all transverse joints. Allow adequate time for emulsion to break completely before placing any \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n318 \nmaterial. The Engineer may suspend paving operations until there is    adequate coverage. Do not dilute \nemulsified asphalts at the terminal, in the field, or at any other location before use, unless required in \nconformance with the manufacturer’s recommendation for approved TRAIL product use on the Department’s \nMPL. \n4.7.2.2. Sampling.  The Engineer will obtain at least one sample of the tack coat binder per project per source in \naccordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part III, and test it to verify compliance in accordance with Item 300. The \nEngineer will notify the Contractor when the sampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample \nfrom the asphalt distributor immediately before use. Label the can with the corresponding lot    and sublot \nnumbers;  producer name; producer facility location; grade; district; date sampled; all applicable bills of lading \n(if available);  and project information, including highway and control-section-job (CSJ) number.  For \nemulsions, the Engineer may test as often as necessary to ensure the residual of the emulsion is greater \nthan or equal to the specification requirement in accordance with Item 300. \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperature in accordance with Table 8 to establish the \nminimum placement temperature of the mixture delivered to the paving operation. \n \nTable 8 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3 \n(°F) \nPG 76 280 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the \nhigh-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt binder used to \nproduce the mixture.  \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld \nthermal camera or infrared thermometer immediately before \nentering MTD or paver.  \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a \nchemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing \ncapabilities, or paver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile.  Use a    handheld thermal camera or a    thermal imaging system to obtain a    continuous \nthermal profile in accordance with Tex-244-F.  Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 342.4.9.3.2., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.1.1. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.1.1.1. Moderate.  Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.1.2. Severe.  Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.2. Thermal Imaging System.  Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide\n \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F to the Engineer daily unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system. \nThe Engineer may suspend paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the paving \nprocess to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested. \n4.7.3.1.3. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the electronic files generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 342.4.2., “Reporting \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n319 \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used. \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. \n4.7.3.2. Windrow Operations.  Operate windrow pickup equipment so that when hot mix is   placed in windrows,\n \nsubstantially all the mixture deposited on the roadbed is   picked up and loaded into the paver. \n4.7.3.3. Hauling Equipment.  Use belly dumps, live-bottom, or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except \nfor paving miscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD with \nremixing capability,  or when a thermal imaging system is used, unless otherwise\n approved. \n4.7.3.4. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than\n \n5   min. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 342.4.9.3.3., “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is   stopped. \n4.8. Compaction. Roll the freshly placed mixture using as many steel-wheeled rollers as necessary,  operated in \nstatic mode, to seat the\n mixture without excessive breakage of the aggregate and to provide a smooth surface \nand uniform texture. Do not use pneumatic rollers. Thoroughly moisten the roller drums with a    soap-and-water \nsolution to prevent\n adhesion. Use only water or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other \ncompaction equipment\n unless otherwise directed. \nUse T\nex-246-F to test and verify that the compacted mixture meets the water flow requirements.  Measure the \nwater flow once per sublot at locations directed by the Engineer. The water flow rate must be less than 20 sec. \nInvestigate the cause of the water flow rate test failures and take corrective actions during production and \nplacement to ensure the water flow rate is less than 20 sec. Suspend production if two consecutive water \nflow rate tests fail,  unless otherwise approved. Resume production after the Engineer approves changes to \nproduction or placement methods. \nComplete all compaction operations before the pavement temperature drops below 180°F, unless otherwise \nallowed. The Engineer may allow compaction with a light finish roller operated in static mode for pavement \ntemperatures below 180°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic, unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan.  Sample and test the hot mix on a lot   -and-sublot basis. \n4.9.1. Referee Testing.  The Materials and Tests Division is   the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee\n testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if the \ndifferences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference in \naccordance with Table 6 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee \ntesting if\n the E ngineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are \nwithin specification limits. Make the request within 5    working days after receiving test results from the\n \nEngineer. Referee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the particular tests in \nquestion. Allow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to \nbe reported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if \nmore than three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee \ntest results than the Contractor’s test results. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n320 \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot. A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 1,000 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 2,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three–four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 1,000 ton and \n4,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \n4.9.2.1.1. Incomplete Production Lots.  If a lot    is    begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of\n production \nor in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Close all lots\n within 5    working \ndays unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. Production Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling.  The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at the \nplant in accordance with Tex-222-F\n.  The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s  testing is   completed. \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample.  At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all   production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots. \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample.  For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split, and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the\n random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s “blind” sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be\n randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample. \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must obtain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, referee\n testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n4.9.2.2.2. Informational Hamburg Wheel and Overlay Testing.  Select one random sublot from Lot 2 or higher for \nHamburg wheel and overlay testing during the first week of production. Obtain and provide the Engineer with \napproximately 90 lb. of mixture, sampled in accordance with Tex-222-F\n, in sealed containers, boxes, or bags \nlabeled with the CSJ number, mixture type, lot number, and sublot number. The Engineer will ship the \nmixture to the Materials and Tests Division for Hamburg wheel and overlay testing. Results from these tests \nwill not be used for specification compliance. \n4.9.2.2.3. Asphalt Binder Sampling.  The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt binder \nfor each lot    of\n mixture produced. The Contractor will notify the Engineer when the sampling will occur. Obtain the \nsample at approximately the same time the mixture random sample is\n obtained. Sample from a    port located \nimmediately upstream from the mixing drum or pug mill and upstream from the introduction of any additives in \naccordance\n with Tex-500-C,  Part II.    Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot numbers, producer \nname, producer facility, grade, District, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if available), and project \ninformation, including highway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain these samples for 1 yr. The \nEngineer may also obtain independent samples. If obtaining an independent asphalt binder sample and upon \nrequest of the Contractor, the Engineer will split a sample of the asphalt binder with the Contractor. \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of each binder grade and source used. \nThe Engineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify compliance with Item \n300, and will retain the other split sample for 1 yr. \n\n2024 Specifications  342 \n321 \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests shown in Table 9. The \nContractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the Engineer. \nDetermine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 6 for all sublots. \nAnytime during production, the Engineer may require the Contractor to verify the following based on\n quantities \nused: \n lime content (within ±0.1% of JMF) when PG binder is specified, and \n fiber content (within ±0.03% of JMF) when PG binder is specified. \nThe Engineer may allow\n alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide \nevidence that results from Tex-236-F, Part I are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate \nmethod unless otherwise directed.  Use the applicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method is \nallowed. \nTable 9 \nProduction and Placement Testing Frequency \nDescription Test Method Min Contractor \nTesting Frequency \nMin Engineer Testing \nFrequency \nIndividual % retained on #200 sieve \nand larger  \nTex-200-F \nor \nTex-236-F\n \n1 per sublot 1 per 12 sublots \n% passing the #200 sieve \nLaboratory-molded density Tex-207-F, Part VIII \n1 per sublot \n \n1 per lot \n \nAsphalt binder content\n1\n Tex-236-F, Part I\n \n1 per sublot\n2 \n \n1 per lot \n \nDrain-down Tex-235-F \n1 per sublot \n \n \n \n \n   \n1 per 12\n \nsublots \n Boil test\n3\n \nTex-530-C 1 per project 1 per project \nMoisture content Tex-212-F, Part II When directed 1 per project \nCantabro loss Tex-245-F \n– \n1 per project \nHamburg wheel test Tex-242-F – 1 per project\n4 \nOverlay test\n \nTex-248-F \n– \n1 per project\n5 \nWater flow test\n6 \nTex-246-F 1 per sublot \n1 per project \nAsphalt binder sampling\n7\n Tex-500-C, Part II – \nTack coat sampling and testing Tex-500-C, Part III – \nThermal profile Tex-244-F \n1 per sublot\n8 \n \n1 per project\n \nShear bond strength test Tex-249-F – 1 per project\n5\n \n1.

Adjust the asphalt binder content or \ngradation to achieve the specified target laboratory-molded density. The asphalt binder content established \nfor JMF2 is not required to be within any tolerance of the optimum asphalt binder content established for \nJMF1; however, mixture produced using JMF2 must meet the VMA requirements for production shown in \nTable 8. If the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt \nbinder content for JMF1, the Engineer may perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F on Lot 1 \nproduction to confirm the indirect tensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. Verify that JMF2 meets the \nmixture requirements shown in Table 4 and Table 5. \n4.4.2.1.15. Mixture Production. Use JMF2 to produce Lot 1 as described in Section 344.4.9.3.1.1., “Lot 1 Placement,” \nafter receiving approval for JMF2 and a passing Hamburg wheel result on the trial batch from a laboratory \nlisted on the MPL. Once JMF2 is approved, and without receiving the results from the Department’s \nHamburg wheel test on the trial batch, the Contractor may proceed to Lot 1 production at their own risk. \nNotify the Engineer if electing to proceed without Hamburg wheel test results from the trial batch. Note that \nthe Engineer may require up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed \nand replaced at the Contractor’s expense. \n4.4.2.1.16. Development of JMF3. Evaluate the test results from Lot 1, determine the optimum mixture proportions, and \nsubmit as JMF3 for use in Lot 2. \n4.4.2.1.17. JMF Adjustments.

The asphalt binder content established for JMF2 is not required \nto be within any tolerance of the optimum asphalt binder content established for JMF1; however, mixture \nproduced using JMF2 must meet the VMA requirements shown in Table 8. If the optimum asphalt binder \ncontent for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF1, the Engineer \nmay perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F on Lot 1 production to confirm the indirect \ntensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. \n4.4.2.2.8. Approval of Lot 1 Production. The Engineer will authorize the Contractor to proceed with JMF2 for Lot 1 \nproduction after a passing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch is achieved from a laboratory listed on \nthe MPL. The Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the \nHamburg wheel test on the trial batch.  \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s sample from the trial batch fails the Hamburg wheel test, the \nEngineer will suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values. The Engineer \nmay require up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test be removed and replaced at \nthe Contractor’s expense. \n4.4.2.2.9. Approval of JMF3 and Subsequent JMF Changes. JMF3 and subsequent JMF changes are approved if \nthey meet the mixture requirements shown in Table 4 and Table 5, and the master gradation limits shown in \nTable 8, and they are within the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 11. Current JMF changes \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n339 \nthat exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 11 may require a new laboratory mixture \ndesign, trial batch, or both. The addition of a WMA additive to facilitate mixing or as a compaction aid does \nnot require a new laboratory mixture design or trial batch. \n4.5. Production Operations.  Perform a new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All source \nchanges for asphalt will require a passing Hamburg wheel test result from a laboratory listed on the MPL. \nThe Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg \nwheel test on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and \ntrial batch. Take corrective action and receive approval to proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. Submit a new mix design and perform a new trial batch when the \nasphalt binder content of: \n any RAP stockpile used in the mix is more than 0.5% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport; or \n RAS stockpile used in the mix is more than 2.0% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials.  Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \nItem 300, or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the Engineer with daily records of \nasphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible increments) in accordance with \nItem 320, unless otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a period long enough to affect the quality of the \nmixture, nor in any case longer than 12 hr. unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperatures shown in Table 12. The Department \nwill not pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperatures \nshown in Table 12. \nTable 12 \nMax Production Temperature  \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 64 325\n2 \nPG 70 335\n2 \nPG 76 345\n2 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the \nhigh-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt binder used \nto produce the mixture. \n2. The Max production temperature of WMA is 275°F. \nProduce WMA within the target discharge temperature range of 215–275°F when WMA is required. Take \ncorrective action anytime the discharge temperature of the WMA exceeds the target discharge range. The \nEngineer may suspend production operations if the Contractor’s corrective action is not successful at \ncontrolling the production temperature within the target discharge range. Note that when WMA is produced, it \nmay be necessary to adjust burners to ensure complete combustion such that no burner fuel residue remains \nin the mixture. \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all moisture is removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F\n, Part II, and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n4.6. Hauling Operations.  Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is not contaminated. Use a \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n340 \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 344.4.7.3.3., “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations. Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide \nthe Department’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is not used, to measure and record the \ninternal temperature of the mixture as discharged from the truck or material transfer device (MTD) before or \nas the mix enters the paver. Measure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, \nor as approved. Include an approximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the \nlocation where the temperature was taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixture meets the temperature \nrequirements shown in Table 12. Calculate the daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift and \nprovide to the Engineer at the end of paving operations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer \nmay suspend production if the Contractor fails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by \nthe end of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt, \nsand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from \npavement edges. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished \nsurface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of hot mix by \nat least 6 in. Place mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6 in. of lane lines, \nare not placed in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as directed. Ensure that \nall finished surfaces will drain properly. Place the mixture at the rate or thickness shown on the plans. The \nEngineer will use the guidelines shown in Table 13 to determine the compacted lift thickness of each layer \nwhen multiple lifts are required. The thickness determined is based on the rate of 110 lb. per square yard for \neach inch of pavement unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n \nTable 13 \nCompacted Lift Thickness and Required Core Height \nMixture \nType \nCompacted Lift Thickness Guidelines \nMin Untrimmed Core \nHeight Eligible for Testing \n(in.) \nMin \n(in.) \nMax \n(in.) \nSP-B 2.50 4.0 2.00 \nSP-C 2.00 3.0 1.25 \nSP-D 1.25 2.0 1.25 \n4.7.1. Weather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a Thermal Imaging System. Place mixture when the roadway surface is dry and the roadway \nsurface temperature is at or above the temperatures shown in Table 14A, unless otherwise approved or \nshown on the plans. Place mixtures only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway \nsurface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. Provide output data from the thermal imaging system to \ndemonstrate to the Engineer that no recurring severe thermal segregation exists in accordance with \nSection 344.4.7.3.1.2., “Thermal Imaging System.” \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n341 \nTable 14A \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \n(°F) \nSubsurface Layers Surface Layers \nPG 64  35 40 \nPG 70 45\n2\n 50\n2\n \nPG 76  45\n2\n 50\n2\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt \nbinder used to produce the mixture. \n2. Contractors may pave at temperatures 10°F lower than these values when a chemical WMA \nadditive is used as a compaction aid in the mixture or when using WMA. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or above the temperatures shown in \nTable 14B,  unless otherwise approved or shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature \nusing a handheld thermal camera or infrared thermometer. The Engineer may allow mixture placement to \nbegin before the roadway surface reaches the required temperature if conditions are such that the roadway \nsurface will reach the required temperature within 2 hr. of beginning placement operations. Place mixtures \nonly when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by \nthe Engineer.  \nTable 14B \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \nHigh-Temperature Binder \nGrade\n1\n \nMin Pavement Surface Temperatures \n(°F) \nSubsurface Layers Surface Layers \nPG 64  45 50 \nPG 70 55\n2\n 60\n2\n \nPG 76  60\n2\n 60\n2\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt \nbinder used to produce the mixture. \n2. The Contractor may pave at temperatures 10°F lower than these values when a chemical \nWMA additive is used as a compaction aid in the mixture, when using WMA, or when using \na paving process with equipment that eliminates thermal segregation. In such cases, for \neach sublot and in the presence of the Engineer, use a handheld thermal camera operated \nin accordance with Tex-244-F\n to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the \nuncompacted mat has no more than 10°F of thermal segregation. \n4.7.2. Tack Coat.  \n4.7.2.1. Application.  Clean the surface before placing the tack coat. The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 gal. \nand 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. Apply a uniform tack coat at the specified \nrate unless otherwise directed. Apply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular \npatterns. Apply the tack coat to all surfaces that will contact the subsequent HMA placement, unless \notherwise directed. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in the longitudinal direction during placement of \nthe mat to ensure bond of adjacent mats, unless otherwise directed. Allow adequate time for emulsion to \nbreak completely before placing any material. Prevent splattering of tack coat when placed adjacent to curb, \ngutter, and structures. The Engineer may suspend paving operations\n until there is   adequate coverage. Do not \ndilute emulsified asphalts at the terminal, in the field, or at any other location before use, unless required in \nconformance with the manufacturer’s recommendation for approved TRAIL products listed on the MPL. \n4.7.2.2. Sampling. The Engineer will obtain at least one sample of the tack coat binder per project per source in \naccordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part III, and test it to verify compliance with Item 300. The Engineer will notify \nthe Contractor when the sampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample from the asphalt \ndistributor immediately before use. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot numbers, producer, \nname; producer facility location, grade, District, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if available), and \nproject information including highway and control-section-job (CSJ) number. For emulsions, the Engineer \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n342 \nmay test as often as necessary to ensure the residual of the emulsion is greater than or equal to the \nspecification requirement in accordance with Item 300. \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperatures in accordance with Table 15 to establish the \nminimum placement temperature of mixture delivered to the paving operation. \nTable 15 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3,4 \n(°F) \nPG 64  260 ̊F \nPG 70 270 ̊F \nPG 76 280 ̊F \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature \ngrade of the virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld \nthermal camera or infrared thermometer immediately before \nentering MTD or paver. \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a \nchemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing \ncapabilities, or paver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n4. When using WMA, the Min placement temperature is 215°F. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile. Use a handheld thermal camera or a thermal imaging system to obtain a continuous \nthermal profile in accordance with Tex-244-F\n. Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 344.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.1.1. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.1.1.1. Moderate. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.1.2. Severe. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.2. Thermal Imaging System. Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F to the Engineer daily, unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system.  \nThe Engineer may suspend paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the paving \nprocess to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system.  \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested by the Engineer. \n4.7.3.1.3. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the thermal images generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 344.4.2., “Reporting \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used.   \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be \npaid for any sublot that contains severe thermal segregation. Evaluate areas with severe thermal segregation \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n343 \nby performing density profiles in accordance with Section 344.4.9.3.3.3., “Segregation (Density Profile).” \nRemove and replace the material in any areas that have severe thermal segregation and a failing result for \nsegregation (density profile) unless otherwise directed. The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \n4.7.3.2. Windrow Operations.  Operate windrow pickup equipment so that when hot mix is placed in windrows, \nsubstantially all the mixture deposited on the roadbed is picked up and loaded into the paver. \n4.7.3.3. Hauling Equipment. Use belly dump, live-bottom, or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except \nfor paving miscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD \nwith remixing capability,  or when a thermal imaging system is used, unless otherwise approved. \n4.7.3.4. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than \n5   min. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 344.4.9.3.3.5., “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is stopped. \n4.8. Compaction. Compact the pavement uniformly to contain between 3.7% and 7.5% in-place air voids. Take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the operation within 3.7% and 7.5% when the in-place air voids exceed \nthe range of these tolerances. The Engineer will allow paving to resume when the proposed corrective action \nis likely to yield between 3.7% and 7.5% in-place air voids. \nObtain cores in areas placed under exempt production, as directed, at locations determined by the Engineer. \nThe Engineer may test these cores and suspend operations or require removal and replacement if the \nin-place air voids are less than 2.7% or more than 9.0%. Areas defined in Section 344.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas,” are not subject to in-place air void determination. \nFurnish the type, size, and number of rollers necessary to ensure desired compaction. Use additional rollers \nas required to remove any roller marks. Use only water or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and \nother compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. \nUse the control strip method in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, on the first day of production to establish \nthe rolling pattern that will produce the desired in-place air voids,  unless otherwise directed. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction using rollers. The Engineer may require rolling using \na trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \nComplete all compaction operations using breakdown rollers before the pavement temperature drops below \n180°F,  unless otherwise allowed. Compaction using a pneumatic or light finish roller operated in static mode \nis allowed for pavement temperatures above 160°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic,  unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan.  Payment adjustments for the material will be in accordance with Article 344.6., \n“Payment.” \nSample and test the hot mix on a lot-and-sublot basis. Suspend production if the production payment factor \nin accordance with Section 344.6.1., “Production Payment Adjustment Factors,” or the placement payment \nfactor in accordance with Section 344.6.2., “Placement Payment Adjustment Factors,” for two consecutive \nlots is below 1.000. Resume production once test results or other information indicates to the satisfaction of \nthe Engineer that the next material produced or placed will result in payment factors of at least 1.000. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n344 \n4.9.1. Referee Testing. The Materials and Tests Division is the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if \nthe differences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference in \naccordance with Table 11 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee \ntesting if the Engineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are \nwithin specification limits. Make the request within 5 working days after receiving test results and cores from \nthe Engineer. Referee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the tests in question. \nAllow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to be \nreported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if more \nthan three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee test \nresults than the Contractor’s test results. \nThe Materials and Tests Division will determine the laboratory-molded density based on the molded specific \ngravity and the maximum theoretical specific gravity of the referee sample. The in-place air voids will be \ndetermined based on the bulk-specific gravity of the cores, as determined by the referee laboratory, and the \nEngineer’s average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. Except for “remove and replace” \nconditions, referee test results are final and will establish payment adjustment factors for the sublot in \nquestion. The Contractor may decline referee testing and accept the Engineer’s test results when the \nplacement payment adjustment factor for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition. Placement \nsublots subject to be removed and replaced will be further evaluated in accordance with Section 344.6.2.2., \n“Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement.” \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot. A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 1,000 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 4,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three–four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 1,000 ton and \n4,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \nIf the optimum asphalt binder content for JMF2 is more than 0.5% lower than the optimum asphalt binder \ncontent for JMF1, the Engineer may perform or require the Contractor to perform Tex-226-F\n on Lot 1 to \nconfirm the indirect tensile strength does not exceed 200 psi. Take corrective action to bring the mixture \nwithin specification compliance if the indirect tensile strength exceeds 200 psi, unless otherwise directed. \n4.9.2.1.1. Incomplete Production Lots.  If a lot is begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of \nproduction or in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Adjust the \npayment for the incomplete lot in accordance with Section 344.6.1., “Production Payment Adjustment \nFactors.” Close all lots within 5 working days unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. Production Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at \nthe plant in accordance with Tex-222-F\n. The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain the custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s testing is completed. \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample. At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F\n. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots.  \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample. For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split,  and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s “blind” sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n345 \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample. \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must obtain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, r  eferee testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n4.9.2.2.2. Asphalt Binder Sampling. The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt \nbinder for each lot of mixture produced. The Contractor will notify the Engineer when the sampling will occur. \nObtain the sample at approximately the same time the mixture random sample is obtained. Sample from a \nport located immediately upstream from the mixing drum or pug mill and upstream from the introduction of \nany additives in accordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part II. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot \nnumbers, producer name, producer facility, grade, District, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if \navailable), and project information, including highway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain these \nsamples for 1 yr. The Engineer may also obtain independent samples. If obtaining an independent asphalt \nbinder sample and upon request of the Contractor, the Engineer will split a sample of the asphalt binder with \nthe Contractor.  \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of each binder grade and source used. The \nEngineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify accordance with Item 300, \nand will retain the other split sample for 1 yr. \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests shown in Table 16. The \nContractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the Engineer. \nDetermine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 11 for all sublots. \nTake immediate corrective action if the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is less than \n95.0% or greater than 97.0% to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may suspend \noperations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. The Engineer will allow \nproduction to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to yield acceptable results. \nThe Engineer may allow alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide \nevidence that results from Tex-236-F, Part I are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate \nmethod unless otherwise directed. Use the applicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method \nis allowed. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n346 \nTable 16 \nProduction and Placement Testing Frequency \nDescription Test Method \nMin Contractor \nTesting Frequency \nMin Engineer \nTesting Frequency \nIndividual % retained on #8 sieve and larger \nTex-200-F \nor \nTex-236-F\n \n1 per sublot 1 per 12 sublots\n1 \nIndividual % retained on sieves smaller than #8 \nand larger than #200 \n% passing the #200 sieve \nLaboratory-molded density \nTex-207-F \n– 1 per sublot\n1 \nLaboratory-molded bulk specific gravity \nIn-place air voids \nVMA Tex-204-F \nSegregation (density profile) Tex-207-F, Part V 1 per sublot\n2\n 1 per project \nLongitudinal joint density Tex-207-F, Part VII 1 per sublot\n3\n 1 per project \nMoisture content Tex-212-F, Part II When directed 1 per project \nTheoretical Max specific (Rice) gravity Tex-227-F  1 per sublot\n1 \nAsphalt binder content Tex-236-F, Part I 1 per sublot 1 per lot\n1 \nThermal profile Tex-244-F 1 per sublot\n2 \n1 per project \nHamburg wheel test Tex-242-F – \nDeleterious in Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS)\n4\n Tex-217-F, Part III – \nAsphalt binder sampling and testing\n4,5\n Tex-500-C, Part II – \nTack coat sampling and testing Tex-500-C, Part III – \nBoil test\n6\n Tex-530-C 1 per lot \nShear bond strength test\n7\n Tex-249-F – \n1. For production defined in Section 344.4.9.4., “Exempt Production,” the Engineer will perform one test per day if \n100 tons or more are produced. For Exempt Production, no testing is required when less than 100 tons are \nproduced. \n2. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer when not using the thermal imaging system, unless otherwise \napproved. \n3. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer. \n4. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or designated laboratory. \n5. Sampling performed by the Contractor. The Engineer will witness sampling and retain the samples for 1 yr. \n6. When shown on the plans. \n7. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or District for informational purposes on a sample obtained \nby the Contractor within the first four lots of the project. \n4.9.2.4. Operational Tolerances. Control the production process within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 11. When production is suspended, the Engineer will allow production to resume when test results or \nother information indicates the next mixture produced will be within the operational tolerances. \n4.9.2.4.1. Gradation.  Suspend operation and take corrective action if any aggregate is retained on the maximum sieve \nsize shown in Table 8. A sublot is defined as out of tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s test \nresults are out of operational tolerance. Suspend production when test results for gradation exceed the \noperational tolerances shown in Table 11 for three consecutive sublots on the same sieve or four \nconsecutive sublots on any sieve unless otherwise directed. The consecutive sublots may be from more than \none lot. \n4.9.2.4.2. Asphalt Binder Content.  A sublot is defined as out of operational tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the \nContractor’s test results exceed the values shown in Table 11. No production or placement payment \nadjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that is out of operational tolerance for asphalt \nbinder content. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s asphalt \nbinder content deviates from the current JMF by more than 0.5% for any sublot. \n4.9.2.4.3. VMA. The Engineer will determine the VMA for every sublot. For sublots when the Engineer does not \ndetermine asphalt binder content, the Engineer will use the asphalt binder content results from QC testing \nperformed by the Contractor to determine VMA. \nTake immediate corrective action if the VMA value for any sublot is less than the minimum VMA requirement \nfor production shown in Table 8. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA \nresults on two consecutive sublots are below the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n347 \nTable 8. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that \ndoes not meet the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 8 based on the Engineer’s VMA \ndetermination. \nSuspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA result is more than 0.5% below the \nminimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 8. In addition to suspending production, the \nEngineer may require removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. \n4.9.2.4.4. Hamburg Wheel Test. The Engineer may perform a Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture anytime \nduring production. Suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values when the \nproduction samples fail the Hamburg wheel test criteria shown in Table 10. The Engineer may require up to \nthe entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed and replaced at the \nContractor’s expense. \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture results in a “remove \nand replace” condition, the Contractor may request that the Materials and Tests Division determine the final \ndisposition of the material in question by re-testing the failing material. \n4.9.2.5. Individual Loads of Hot Mix. The Engineer may reject individual truckloads of hot mix. When a load of hot \nmix is rejected for reasons other than temperature, contamination, or excessive uncoated particles, the \nContractor may request that the rejected load be tested. Make this request within 4 hr. of rejection. The \nEngineer will sample and test the mixture. If test results are within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 11, payment will be made for the load. If test results are not within operational tolerances, no payment \nwill be made for the load. \n4.9.3. Placement Acceptance. \n4.9.3.1. Placement Lot. A placement lot consists of four placement sublots. A placement sublot consists of the area \nplaced during a production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.1. Lot 1 Placement. Placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 for Lot 1 will be in accordance with \nSection 344.6.2., “Placement Payment Adjustment Factors”; however, no placement adjustment less than \n1.000 will be assessed for any sublot placed in Lot 1 when the in-place air voids are greater than or equal to \n2.7% and less than or equal to 9.0%. Remove and replace any sublot with in-place air voids less than 2.7% \nor greater than 9.0%. \n4.9.3.1.2. Incomplete Placement Lots. An incomplete placement lot consists of the area placed as described in \nSection 344.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” excluding areas defined in Section 344.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas.” Placement sampling is required if the random sample plan for production resulted in \na sample being obtained from an incomplete production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.3. Shoulders, Ramps, Etc. Shoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn \nlanes are subject to in-place air void determination and payment adjustments unless shown on the plans as \nnot eligible for in-place air void determination. Intersections may be considered miscellaneous areas when \ndetermined by the Engineer. \n4.9.3.1.4. Miscellaneous Areas. Miscellaneous areas include areas that typically involve significant handwork or \ndiscontinuous paving operations, such as temporary detours, driveways, mailbox turnouts, crossovers, \ngores, spot level-up areas, pavement repair sections less than 300 ft., and other similar areas. Temporary \ndetours are subject to in-place air void determination when shown on the plans. Miscellaneous areas also \ninclude level-ups and thin overlays when the layer thickness shown on the plans is less than the minimum \nuntrimmed core height eligible for testing in accordance with Table 13. The specified layer thickness is based \non the rate of 110 lb. per square yard for each inch of pavement unless another rate is shown on the plans. \nWhen “Level Up” is listed as part of the item bid description code, a payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will \nbe assigned for all placement sublots as described in Article 344.6., “Payment.” Miscellaneous areas are not \neligible for random placement sampling locations. Compact miscellaneous areas in accordance with \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n348 \nSection 344.4.8., “Compaction.” Miscellaneous areas are not subject to in-place air void determination, \nthermal profiles testing, segregation (density profiles), or longitudinal joint density evaluations. \n4.9.3.2. Placement Sampling.  The Engineer will select random numbers for all placement sublots at the beginning \nof the project. The Engineer will provide the Contractor with the placement random numbers only \nimmediately after the sublot is completed. Mark the roadway location at the completion of each sublot and \nrecord the station number. Determine one random sample location for each placement sublot in accordance \nwith Tex-225-F. Adjust the random sample location by no more than necessary to achieve a 2-ft. clearance if \nthe location is within 2 ft. of a joint or pavement edge. \nShoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn lanes are always eligible for \nselection as a random sample location; however, if a random sample location falls on one of these areas and \nthe area is designated on the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination, cores will not be taken \nfor the sublot and a 1.000 pay factor will be assigned to that sublot. \nProvide the equipment and means to obtain and trim roadway cores onsite. Onsite is defined as in close \nproximity to where the cores are taken. Obtain the cores within 1 working day of the time the placement \nsublot is completed, unless otherwise approved. Obtain two 6-in. diameter cores side-by-side from within 1 ft. \nof the random location provided for the placement sublot. Mark the cores for identification, measure and \nrecord the untrimmed core height, and provide the information to the Engineer. The Engineer will witness the \ncoring operation and measurement of the core thickness. Visually inspect each core and verify that the \ncurrent paving layer is bonded to the underlying layer. Take corrective action if an adequate bond does not \nexist between the current and underlying layer to ensure that an adequate bond will be achieved during \nsubsequent placement operations. \nTrim the cores immediately after obtaining them from the roadway in accordance with Tex-251-F if the core \nheights meet the minimum untrimmed value shown in Table 13. Trim the cores onsite in the presence of the \nEngineer. Use a permanent marker or paint pen to record the lot and sublot numbers on each core, as well \nas the designation as Core A or Core B. The Engineer may require additional information to be marked on \nthe core and may choose to sign or initial the core. The Engineer will take custody of the cores immediately \nafter witnessing the trimming of the cores and will retain custody of the cores until the Department’s testing is \ncompleted. Before turning the trimmed cores over to the Engineer, the Contractor may wrap the trimmed \ncores or secure them in a manner that will reduce the risk of possible damage occurring during transport by \nthe Engineer. After testing, the Engineer will return the cores to the Contractor. \nThe Engineer may have the cores transported back to the Department’s laboratory at the HMA plant via the \nContractor’s haul truck or other designated vehicle. In such cases where the cores will be out of the \nEngineer’s possession during transport, the Engineer will use Department-provided security bags and the \nroadway core custody protocol located on the Department’s website to provide a secure means and process \nthat protects the integrity of the cores during transport. \nDecide whether to include the pair of cores in the air void determination for that sublot if the core height \nbefore trimming is less than the minimum untrimmed value in accordance with Table 13. Trim the cores as \ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs before delivering to the Engineer if electing to have the cores included \nin the air void determination. If electing to not have the cores included in air void determination, inform the \nEngineer of the decision and deliver untrimmed cores to the Engineer. The placement pay factor for the \nsublot will be 1.000 if cores will not be included in air void determination. \nInstead of the Contractor trimming the cores onsite immediately after coring, the Engineer and the Contractor \nmay mutually agree to have the trimming operations performed at an alternate location, such as a field \nlaboratory or other similar location. In such cases, the Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately \nafter they are obtained from the roadway and will retain custody of the cores until testing is completed. Either \nthe Department or Contractor representative may perform trimming of the cores. The Engineer will witness all \ntrimming operations in cases where the Contractor representative performs the trimming operation. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n349 \nDry the core holes and tack the sides and bottom immediately after obtaining the cores. Fill the hole with the \nsame type of mixture, and properly compact the mixture. Repair core holes using other methods when \napproved. \n4.9.3.3. Placement Testing.  Perform placement tests in accordance with Table 16. After the Engineer returns the \ncores, the Contractor may test the cores to verify the Engineer’s test results for in-place air voids. The \nallowable differences between the Contractor’s and Engineer’s test results are shown in Table 11. \n4.9.3.3.1. In-Place Air Voids. The Engineer will measure in-place air voids in accordance with Tex-207-F\n and \nTex-227-F. Before drying to a constant weight, cores may be pre-dried using a CoreDry or similar vacuum \ndevice to remove excess moisture. The Engineer will average the values obtained for all sublots in the \nproduction lot to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity. The Engineer will use the average air \nvoid content for in-place air voids. \nThe Engineer will use the vacuum method to seal the core if required in accordance with Tex-207-F. The \nEngineer will use the test results from the unsealed core to determine the placement payment adjustment \nfactor if the sealed core yields a higher specific gravity than the unsealed core. After determining the in-place \nair void content, the Engineer will return the cores and provide test results to the Contractor. \n4.9.3.3.2. Informational Shear Bond Strength Testing. The Engineer will select one random sublot within the first \nfour lots of the project for shear bond strength testing. Obtain full-depth cores in accordance with Tex-249-F\n \nunless the HMA is being placed directly on concrete pavement. Label the cores with lot and sublot numbers, \nand provide to the Engineer. Inspector must use pertinent Department form to document the CSJ number, \nproducer of the tack coat, mix type, and shot rate. The Engineer will ship the cores to the Materials and Tests \nDivision or District laboratory for shear bond strength testing. Results from these tests will not be used for \nspecification compliance. \n4.9.3.3.3. Segregation (Density Profile). Test for segregation using density profiles in accordance with Tex-207-F, \nPart V. Density profiles are not required and are not applicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nDensity profiles are not applicable in areas described in Section 344.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nPerform at least one density profile per sublot. Perform additional density profiles when any of the following \nconditions occur, unless otherwise approved. \n Areas that are identified by either the Contractor or the Engineer with severe thermal segregation.  \n Any visibly segregated areas that exist. \n The paver stops due to lack of material being delivered to the paving operations and the temperature \nof the uncompacted mat before the initial breakdown rolling is lower than the temperatures shown in \nTable 17. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n350 \nTable 17 \nMin Uncompacted Mat Temperature Requiring Segregation Profile\n1 \nHigh-Temperature Binder Grade\n2\n \nMin Temperature of Uncompacted Mat \nAllowed Before Initial Breakdown \nRolling\n3,4,5 \n(°F) \nPG 64 <250 \nPG 70 <260 \nPG 76 <270 \n1. Applicable only to paver stops that occur due to lack of material being delivered to the \npaving operations and when not using a thermal imaging system. \n2. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin \nasphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \n3. The surface of the uncompacted mat must be measured using a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer. \n4. Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a segregation profile may be reduced 20°F \nif using a chemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing capabilities, \nor paver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n5. When using WMA, the Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a segregation \nprofile is 215°F. \nProvide the Engineer with the density profile of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion \nof each lot. Report the results of each density profile in accordance with Section 344.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nThe density profile is considered failing if it exceeds the tolerances shown in Table 18. When a thermal \nimaging system is not used, the Engineer will measure the density profile at least once per project. The \nEngineer’s density profile results will be used when available. The Engineer may require the Contractor to \nremove and replace the area in question if the area fails the density profile and has surface irregularities as \ndefined in Section 344.4.9.3.3.6., “Irregularities.” The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \nInvestigate density profile failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to eliminate \nthe segregation. Suspend production if two consecutive density profiles fail unless otherwise approved. \nResume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \n \nTable 18 \nSegregation (Density Profile) Acceptance Criteria \nMixture Type \nMax Allowable \nDensity Range \n(Highest to Lowest) \nMax Allowable \nDensity Range \n(Average to Lowest) \nSP-B 8.0 pcf 5.0 pcf \nSP-C & SP-D 6.0 pcf 3.0 pcf \n4.9.3.3.4. Longitudinal Joint Density. \n4.9.3.3.4.1. Informational Tests.  Perform joint density evaluations while establishing the rolling pattern and verify that \nthe joint density is no more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at or near the center of the mat. Adjust the \nrolling pattern, if needed, to achieve the desired joint density. Perform additional joint density evaluations,  at \nleast once per sublot, unless otherwise directed. \n4.9.3.3.4.2. Record Tests. Perform a joint density evaluation for each sublot at each pavement edge that is or will \nbecome a longitudinal joint. Joint density evaluations are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 344.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” Determine the joint density in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, \nPart VII. Record the joint density information and submit results on Department forms to the Engineer. The \nevaluation is considered failing if the joint density is more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at the core \nrandom sample location and the correlated joint density is less than 90.0%. The Engineer will make \nindependent joint density verification at least once per project and may make independent joint density \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n351 \nverifications at the random sample locations. The Engineer’s joint density test results will be used when \navailable. \nProvide the Engineer with the joint density of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion of \neach lot. Report the results of each joint density in accordance with Section 344.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nInvestigate joint density failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to improve the \njoint density. Suspend production if the evaluations on two consecutive sublots fail,  unless otherwise \napproved. Resume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \n4.9.3.3.5. Recovered Asphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The Engineer may take production samples or \ncores from suspect areas of the project to determine recovered asphalt properties. Asphalt binders with an \naging ratio greater than 3.5 do not meet the requirements for recovered asphalt properties and may be \ndeemed defective when tested and evaluated by the Materials and Tests Division. The aging ratio is the DSR \nvalue of the extracted binder divided by the DSR value of the original unaged binder. Obtain DSR values in \naccordance with AASHTO T 315 at the specified high-temperature PG of the asphalt. The Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement of the defective material at the Contractor’s expense. The asphalt binder \nwill be recovered for testing from production samples or cores in accordance with Tex-211-F\n. \n4.9.3.3.6. Irregularities. Identify and correct irregularities,  including segregation, rutting, raveling, flushing, fat spots, \nmat slippage, irregular color, irregular texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, uncoated aggregate \nparticles, or broken aggregate particles. The Engineer may also identify irregularities, and in such cases, the \nEngineer will promptly notify the Contractor. If the Engineer determines that the irregularity will adversely \naffect pavement performance, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace (at the \nContractor’s expense) areas of the pavement that contain irregularities. The Engineer may also require the \nContractor to remove and replace (at the Contractor’s expense) areas where the mixture does not bond to \nthe existing pavement. \nIf irregularities are detected, the Engineer may require the Contractor to immediately suspend operations or \nmay allow the Contractor to continue operations for no more than 1 day while the Contractor is taking \nappropriate corrective action. \n4.9.4. Exempt Production. The mixture may be deemed as exempt production when mutually agreed between the \nEngineer and the Contractor or when shown on the plans. Exempt production may be used for the following \nconditions. \n Anticipated daily production is less than 500 ton.  \n Total production for the project is less than 5,000 ton.  \n Pavement repair sections are equal to or greater than 300 ft. For pavement repair sections less than \n300 ft., refer to Section 344.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nExempt production is not eligible for referee testing. For exempt production, the Contractor is relieved of all \nproduction and placement QC and QA sampling and testing requirements, except for coring operations when \nrequired by the Engineer. When mutually agreed between the Engineer and the Contractor, production \nsampling will be allowed at the point of delivery. When 100 ton or more per day is produced, the Engineer \nmust perform acceptance tests for production and placement shown in Table 16. If the specification \nrequirements listed below are met, the production and placement pay factors are 1.000. \n Produce, haul, place, and compact the mixture in accordance with the Specification and as directed. \n Control mixture production must yield a laboratory-molded density that is within ±1.0% of the target \nlaboratory-molded density as tested by the Engineer. \n Compact the mixture in accordance with Section 344.4.8., “Compaction.” \n When a thermal imaging system is not used, the Engineer may perform segregation (density profiles) \nand thermal profiles in accordance with the specification; and \n Complete all other specification requirements. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n352 \n4.9.5. Ride Quality. Measure ride quality in accordance with Item 585, “Ride Quality for Pavement Surfaces,” \nunless otherwise shown on the plans. \n5. MEASUREMENT \n5.1. Superpave Mixtures. Hot mix will be measured by the ton of composite hot mix, which includes asphalt, \naggregate, and additives. Measure the weight on scales in accordance with Item 520, “Weighing and \nMeasuring Equipment.” \n5.2. Tack Coat.  Tack coat will be measured at the applied temperature by strapping the tank before and after \nroad application and determining the net volume in gallons from the calibrated distributor. The Engineer will \nwitness all strapping operations for volume determination. All tack, including emulsions, will be measured by \nthe gallon applied.  \nThe Engineer may allow the use of a metering device to determine asphalt volume used and application rate \nif the device is accurate within 1.5% of the strapped volume. \n6. PAYMENT \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 344.5.1., “Superpave Mixtures,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Superpave Mixtures” of the \nmixture type, SAC, and binder specified. These prices are full compensation for surface preparation, \nmaterials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 344.5.2., “Tack Coat,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Tack Coat” of the tack coat provided. \nThese prices are full compensation for materials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nPayment adjustments will be applied as determined in accordance with this Item; however, a payment \nadjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned for all placement sublots for level-ups only when “Level Up” is \nlisted as part of the bid item description. A payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to all \nproduction and placement sublots when “Exempt” is listed as part of the bid item description, and all testing \nrequirements are met. \nPayment for each sublot, including applicable payment adjustments greater than 1.000, will be paid only for \nsublots when the Contractor supplies the Engineer with the required documentation for production and \nplacement QC and QA, thermal profiles, segregation density profiles, and longitudinal joint densities in \naccordance with Section 344.4.2., “Reporting and Responsibilities.” When a thermal imaging system is used, \ndocumentation is not required for thermal profiles or segregation density profiles on individual sublots; \nhowever, the thermal imaging system automated reports in accordance with Tex-244-F\n are required. \nTrial batches will not be paid for unless they are included in pavement work approved by the Department. \nPayment adjustment for ride quality will be determined in accordance with Item 585. \n6.1. Production Payment Adjustment Factors.  The production payment adjustment factor is based on the \nlaboratory-molded density using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk-specific gravities of the samples from \neach sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s maximum theoretical specific gravity for the sublot. The \nindividual sample densities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the production payment adjustment \nfactor shown in Table 19 for each sublot, using the deviation from the target laboratory-molded density \nshown in Table 9. The production payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the average of the \npayment adjustment factors for the four sublots sampled within that lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n353 \nTable 19 \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factors for Laboratory-Molded Density\n1\n \nAbsolute Deviation from \nTarget Laboratory-Molded Density \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factor \n(Target Laboratory-Molded Density) \n0.0 1.075 \n0.1 1.075 \n0.2 1.075 \n0.3 1.066 \n0.4 1.057 \n0.5 1.047 \n0.6 1.038 \n0.7 1.029 \n0.8 1.019 \n0.9 1.010 \n1.0 1.000 \n1.1 0.900 \n1.2 0.800 \n1.3 0.700 \n>1.3 Remove and replace \n1. If the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is <95.0% or >97.0%, take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may \nsuspend operations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. \nThe Engineer will allow production to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to \nyield acceptable results. \n6.1.1. Payment for Incomplete Production Lots. Production payment adjustments for incomplete lots, described \nunder Section 344.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” will be calculated using the average production \npayment factors from all sublots sampled.  \nA production payment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot when the random sampling plan did not \nresult in collection of any samples within the first sublot. \n6.1.2. Production Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the laboratory-molded \ndensity for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as shown in Table 19, the Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer \nmay also accept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized \nWork.” Replacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in accordance with this \nSection. \n6.2. Placement Payment Adjustment Factors. The placement payment adjustment factor is based on in-place \nair voids using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk-specific gravities of the cores from each sublot will be \ndivided by the Engineer’s average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. The individual core \ndensities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the placement payment adjustment factor shown in \nTable 20 for each sublot that requires in-place air void measurement. A placement payment adjustment \nfactor of 1.000 will be assigned to the entire sublot when the random sample location falls in an area shown \non the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination. A placement payment adjustment factor of \n1.000 will be assigned to quantities placed in areas described in Section 344.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous \nAreas.” The placement payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the average of the placement \npayment adjustment factors for up to four sublots within that lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n354 \nTable 20 \nPlacement Payment Adjustment Factors for In-Place Air Voids \nIn-Place \nAir Voids \nPlacement Payment \nAdjustment Factor \nIn-Place \nAir Voids \nPlacement Payment \nAdjustment Factor \n<2.7 Remove and replace 5.9 1.048 \n2.7 0.710 6.0 1.045 \n2.8 0.740 6.1 1.042 \n2.9 0.770 6.2 1.039 \n3.0 0.800 6.3 1.036 \n3.1 0.830 6.4 1.033 \n3.2 0.860 6.5 1.030 \n3.3 0.890 6.6 1.027 \n3.4 0.920 6.7 1.024 \n3.5 0.950 6.8 1.021 \n3.6 0.980 6.9 1.018 \n3.7 1.000 7.0 1.015 \n3.8 1.015 7.1 1.012 \n3.9 1.030 7.2 1.009 \n4.0 1.045 7.3 1.006 \n4.1 1.060 7.4 1.003 \n4.2 1.075 7.5 1.000 \n4.3 1.075 7.6 0.980 \n4.4 1.075 7.7 0.960 \n4.5 1.075 7.8 0.940 \n4.6 1.075 7.9 0.920 \n4.7 1.075 8.0 0.900 \n4.8 1.075 8.1 0.880 \n4.9 1.075 8.2 0.860 \n5.0 1.075 8.3 0.840 \n5.1 1.072 8.4 0.820 \n5.2 1.069 8.5 0.800 \n5.3 1.066 8.6 0.780 \n5.4 1.063 8.7 0.760 \n5.5 1.060 8.8 0.740 \n5.6 1.057 8.9 0.720 \n5.7 1.054 9.0 0.700 \n5.8 1.051 >9.0 Remove and replace \n6.2.1. Payment for Incomplete Placement Lots. Payment adjustments for incomplete placement lots described \nunder Section 344.4.9.3.1.2., “Incomplete Placement Lots,” will be calculated using the average of the \nplacement pay factors from all sublots sampled and sublots where the random location falls in an area shown \non the plans as not eligible for in-place air void determination.  \nIf the random sampling plan results in production samples, but not in placement samples, the random core \nlocation and placement adjustment factor for the sublot will be determined by applying the placement random \nnumber to the length of the sublot placed. \nIf the random sampling plan results in placement samples, but not in production samples, no placement \nadjustment factor will apply for that sublot placed.  \nA placement payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot when the random sampling plan \ndid not result in collection of any production samples. \n6.2.2. Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the placement payment \nadjustment factor for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as listed in Table 20, the \nEngineer will choose the location of two cores to be taken within 3 ft. of the original failing core location. The \nContractor must obtain the cores in the presence of the Engineer. The Engineer will take immediate \npossession of the untrimmed cores and submit the untrimmed cores to the Materials and Tests Division, \nwhere they will be trimmed, if necessary, and tested for bulk-specific gravity within 10 working days of \nreceipt. \n\n2024 Specifications  344 \n355 \nThe bulk-specific gravity of each core from each sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s average maximum \ntheoretical specific gravity for the lot. The individual core densities for the sublot will be averaged to \ndetermine the new payment adjustment factor of the sublot in question. If the new payment adjustment factor \nis 0.700 or greater, the new payment adjustment factor will apply to that sublot. If the new payment \nadjustment factor is less than 0.700, no payment will be made for the sublot. Remove and replace the failing \nsublot, or the Engineer may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer may also \naccept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized Work.” \nReplacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in accordance with this Section. \n6.3. Total Adjusted Pay (TAP) Calculation. TAP will be based on the applicable payment adjustment factors for \nproduction and placement for each lot. \nTAP = (A+B)/2 \nwhere: \nA = Bid price × production lot quantity × average payment adjustment factor for the production lot \nB = Bid price × placement lot quantity × average payment adjustment factor for the placement lot + (bid price \n× quantity placed in miscellaneous areas × 1.000) \nProduction lot quantity = Quantity actually placed - quantity left in place without payment \nPlacement lot quantity = Quantity actually placed - quantity left in place without payment - quantity placed in \nmiscellaneous areas. \n \n \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n356 \n \nItem 346 \nStone-Matrix Asphalt \n1. DESCRIPTION \nConstruct a hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavement layer composed of compacted stone-matrix asphalt (SMA) or \nstone-matrix asphalt rubber (SMAR) mixture of aggregate, asphalt binder, and additives mixed hot in a \nmixing plant. Payment adjustments will apply to HMA in accordance with this Specification unless the HMA is \ndeemed exempt in accordance with Section 346.4.9.4., “Exempt Production.” \n2. MATERIALS \nFurnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality that meet the requirements of the plans and \nspecifications. \nNotify the Engineer of all material sources and before changing any material source or formulation. The \nEngineer will verify that the specification requirements are met and document all material source changes \nwhen the Contractor makes a source or formulation change. The Engineer may sample and test project \nmaterials anytime during the project to verify specification compliance in accordance with Item 6, “Control of \nMaterials.” \n2.1. Aggregate. Furnish aggregates from sources that conform to the requirements shown in Table 1 and this \nSection. Aggregate requirements in this Section, including those shown in Table 1, may be modified or \neliminated when shown on the plans. Additional aggregate requirements may be specified when shown on \nthe plans. Provide aggregate stockpiles that meet the definitions in this Section for coarse, intermediate, or \nfine aggregate. Aggregate from reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is not required to meet requirements \nshown in Table 1 unless otherwise shown on the plans. Supply aggregates that meet the definitions in \nTex-100-E\n for crushed gravel or crushed stone. The Engineer will designate the plant or the quarry as the \nsampling location. Provide samples from materials produced for the project. The Engineer will establish the \nSurface Aggregate Classification (SAC) and perform Los Angeles abrasion, magnesium sulfate soundness, \nand Micro-Deval tests. Perform all other aggregate quality tests in accordance with Table 1. Document all \ntest results in the mixture design report. The Engineer may perform tests on independent or split samples to \nverify Contractor test results. Stockpile aggregates for each source and type separately. Determine \naggregate gradations for mixture design and production testing based on the washed sieve analysis in \naccordance with \nTex-200-F, Part II. \n2.1.1. Coarse Aggregate. Coarse aggregate stockpiles must have no more than 20% material passing the No. 8 \nsieve. Aggregates from sources listed in the Department’s Bituminous Rated Source Quality Catalog \n(BRSQC) are preapproved for use. Use only the rated values for HMA listed in the BRSQC. Rated values for \nsurface treatment (ST) do not apply to coarse aggregate sources used in HMA. \nFor sources not listed in the Department’s BRSQC: \n build an individual stockpile for each material; \n request the Department test the stockpile for specification compliance; \n allow 30 calendar days for the Engineer to sample, test, and report results;  \n use only when tested and approved; and \n once approved, do not add additional material to the stockpile unless otherwise allowed by the \nEngineer. \nProvide coarse aggregate with at least the minimum SAC shown on the plans. SAC requirements apply only \nto aggregates used on the surface of travel lanes, unless otherwise shown on the plans. The SAC for \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n357 \nsources in the Department’s Aggregate Quality Monitoring Program (AQMP) (Tex-499-A\n) is listed in the \nBRSQC. \n2.1.1.1. Blending Class A and Class B Aggregates. Class B aggregate meeting all other requirements shown in \nTable 1 may be blended with a Class A aggregate to meet requirements for Class A materials, unless \notherwise shown on the plans. When blending Class A and Class B aggregates to meet a Class A \nrequirement, ensure that at least 50% by weight, or volume if required, of the material retained on the No. 4 \nsieve comes from the Class A aggregate source, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Blend by volume if \nthe bulk-specific gravities of the Class A and Class B aggregates differ by more than 0.300. Coarse \naggregate from RAP and recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) will be considered as Class B aggregate for \nblending purposes. Class B aggregate may be disallowed when shown on the plans. \nThe Engineer may perform tests anytime during production, when the Contractor blends Class A and Class B \naggregates to meet a Class A requirement. The Engineer will use the Department’s mix design template, \nwhen electing to verify conformance, to calculate the percent of Class A aggregate retained on the No. 4 \nsieve by inputting the bin percentages shown from readouts in the control room at the time of production and \nstockpile gradations measured at the time of production. The Engineer may determine the gradations based \non either washed or dry sieve analysis from samples obtained from individual aggregate cold feed bins or \naggregate stockpiles. The Engineer may perform spot checks to verify the percent of Class A aggregate \nretained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer will use the gradations supplied by the Contractor in the mixture \ndesign report as an input for the template. A failing spot check will require confirmation with a stockpile \ngradation determined by the Engineer. \n2.1.1.2. Micro-Deval Abrasion. The Engineer will perform at least one Micro-Deval abrasion test in accordance with \nTex-461-A\n for each coarse aggregate source used in the mixture design that has a rated source soundness \nmagnesium (RSSM) loss value greater than 15 as listed in the BRSQC. The Engineer will perform testing \nbefore the start of production and may perform additional testing anytime during production. The Engineer \nmay obtain the coarse aggregate samples from each coarse aggregate source or may require the Contractor \nto obtain the samples. The Engineer may waive all Micro-Deval testing based on a satisfactory test history of \nthe same aggregate source. \nThe Engineer will estimate the magnesium sulfate soundness loss for each coarse aggregate source, when \ntested, using the following formula: \nMg\nest.\n= (RSSM)/(MD\nact.\n/RSMD) \nwhere: \nMg\nest. \n= magnesium sulfate soundness loss \nRSSM = rated source soundness magnesium \nMD\nact. \n= actual Micro-Deval percent loss \nRSMD = rated source Micro-Deval \nWhen the estimated magnesium sulfate soundness loss is greater than the maximum magnesium sulfate \nsoundness loss specified, the coarse aggregate source will not be allowed for use unless otherwise \napproved. The Engineer will consult the Materials and Tests Division, and additional testing may be required \nbefore granting approval. \n2.1.2. Intermediate Aggregate. Aggregates not meeting the definition of coarse or fine aggregate will be defined \nas intermediate aggregate. Supply intermediate aggregates, when used, that are free of organic impurities. \nSupply intermediate aggregate from coarse aggregate sources, when used that meet the requirements \nshown in Table 1, unless otherwise approved. \n2.1.3. Fine Aggregate. Fine aggregates consist of manufactured sands, screenings, and field sands. Fine \naggregate stockpiles must meet the fine aggregate properties in accordance with Table 1 and the gradation \nrequirements in accordance with Table 2. Supply fine aggregates that are free of organic impurities. The \nEngineer may test the fine aggregate in accordance with Tex-408-A\n to verify the material is free of organic \nimpurities. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, at most 15% of the total aggregate may be field sand or \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n358 \nother uncrushed fine aggregate.

Current JMF changes that exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 9 may require \na new laboratory mixture design, trial batch, or both. The addition of a WMA additive to facilitate mixing or as \na compaction aid does not require a new laboratory mixture design or trial batch. \n4.5. Production Operations. Perform a new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All source \nchanges for asphalt will require a passing Hamburg wheel test result from a laboratory listed on the MPL. \nThe Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg \nwheel test on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and \ntrial batch. Take corrective action and receive approval to proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. Submit a new mix design and perform a new trial batch when the \nasphalt binder content of: \n any RAP stockpile used in the mix is more than 0.5% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport,  or \n RAS stockpile used in the mix is more than 2.0% higher than the value shown in the mixture design \nreport. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials. Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \nItem 300, or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the Engineer with daily records of \nasphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible increments) in accordance with \nItem 320, unless otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a period long enough to affect the quality of the \nmixture, nor in any case longer than 12 hr. unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperature shown in Table 10. The Department will \nnot pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperature shown \nin Table 10. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n371 \nTable 10 \nMax Production Temperature \nHigh-Temperature Binder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 76 345\n2\n \nA-R binder 345\n2\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt \nbinder used to produce the mixture.  \n2. The Max production temperature of WMA is 275°F. \nProduce WMA within the target discharge temperature range of 215–275°F when WMA is required. Take \ncorrective action anytime the discharge temperature of the WMA exceeds the target discharge range. The \nEngineer may suspend production operations if the Contractor’s corrective action is not successful at \ncontrolling the production temperature within the target discharge range. Note that when WMA is produced, it \nmay be necessary to adjust burners to ensure complete combustion such that no burner fuel residue remains \nin the mixture. \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all moisture is removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F\n, Part II, and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n4.6. Hauling Operations. Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is not contaminated. Use a \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 346.4.7.3.3., “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations. Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide \nthe Department’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is not used, to measure and record the \ninternal temperature of the mixture as discharged from the truck or material transfer device (MTD) before or \nas the mix enters the paver. Measure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, \nor as approved. Include an approximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the \nlocation where the temperature was taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixture meets the temperature \nrequirements shown in Table 10. Calculate the daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift and \nprovide to the Engineer at the end of paving operations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer \nmay suspend production if the Contractor fails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by \nthe end of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt, \nsand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from \npavement edges. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished \nsurface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of hot mix by \nat least 6 in. Place mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6 in. of lane lines, \nare not placed in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as directed. Ensure that \nall finished surfaces will drain properly. Place the mixture at the rate or thickness shown on the plans. The \nEngineer will use the guidelines shown in Table 11 to determine the compacted lift thickness of each layer \nwhen multiple lifts are required. The thickness determined is based on the rate of 110 lb. per square yard for \neach inch of pavement unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n372 \nTable 11 \nCompacted Lift Thickness and Required Core Height \nMixture Type \nCompacted Lift Thickness Guidelines \nMin Untrimmed Core Height \nEligible for Testing \n(in.) \nMin \n(in.) \nMax \n(in.) \nSMA-C 2.25 4.00 1.75 \nSMA-D 1.50 3.00 1.25 \nSMA-F 1.25 2.00 1.25 \nSMAR-F 1.50 3.00 1.25 \n4.7.1. Weather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a Thermal Imaging System. Place mixture when the roadway is dry and the roadway surface \ntemperature is at or above 60°F,  unless otherwise approved or as shown on the plans. Place mixtures only \nwhen weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by the \nEngineer. Provide output data from the thermal imaging system to demonstrate to the Engineer that no \nrecurring severe thermal segregation exists in accordance with Section 346.4.7.3.1.2., “Thermal Imaging \nSystem.” \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to \nfacilitate compaction when the air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or above 70°F,  unless otherwise \napproved or as shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature using a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer. Place mixtures only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the \nroadway surface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. The Engineer may restrict the Contractor from \npaving if the air temperature is 60°F and falling. \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to \nfacilitate compaction when the air temperature is 70°F and falling.  \n4.7.2. Tack Coat.  \n4.7.2.1. Application. Clean the surface before placing the tack coat. The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 gal. \nand 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. Apply a uniform tack coat at the specified \nrate unless otherwise directed. Apply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular \npatterns. Apply the tack coat to all surfaces that will come in contact with the subsequent HMA placement, \nunless otherwise directed. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in the longitudinal direction during \nplacement of the mat to ensure bond of adjacent mats, unless otherwise directed. Allow adequate time for \nemulsion to break completely before placing any material. Prevent splattering of tack coat when placed \nadjacent to curb, gutter, and structures. The Engineer may suspend paving operations\n until there is adequate \ncoverage. Do not dilute emulsified asphalts at the terminal, in the field, or at any other location before use, \nunless required in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendation for approved TRAIL products on \nthe MPL. \n4.7.2.2. Sampling. The Engineer will obtain at least one sample of the tack coat binder per project per source in \naccordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part III, and test it to verify compliance with Item 300. The Engineer will notify \nthe Contractor when the sampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample from the asphalt \ndistributor immediately before use. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot numbers, producer \nname, producer facility location; grade; District;  date sampled; all applicable bills of ladings (if available), and \nproject information, including highway and CSJ number. For emulsions, the Engineer may test as often as \nnecessary to ensure the residual of the emulsion is greater than or equal to the specification requirement in \nItem 300. \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperature shown in Table 12 to establish the minimum \nplacement temperature of mixture delivered to the paving operation. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n373 \nTable 12 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature Binder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3,4 \n(°F) \nPG 76 280 \nA-R binder 280 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt \nbinder used to produce the mixture. \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld thermal camera or infrared \nthermometer immediately before entering MTD or paver. \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a chemical WMA additive as a \ncompaction aid, MTD with remixing capabilities, or paver hopper insert with remixing \ncapabilities. \n4. When using WMA, the Min placement temperature is 215°F. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile. Use a hand-held thermal camera or a thermal imaging system to obtain a continuous \nthermal profile in accordance with Tex-244-F\n. Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 346.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.1.1. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.1.1.1. Moderate.  Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.1.2. Severe. Any areas that have a    temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.2. Thermal Imaging System. Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F\n to the Engineer daily,  unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system. \nThe Engineer may suspend subsequent paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the \npaving process to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested. \n4.7.3.1.3. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the thermal images generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 346.4.2., “Reporting \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used. \n \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be \npaid for any sublot that contains severe thermal segregation. Evaluate areas with severe thermal segregation \nby performing density profiles in accordance with Section 346.4.9.3.3.3., “Segregation (Density Profile).” \nRemove and replace the material in any areas that have severe thermal segregation and a failing result for \nsegregation (density profile) unless otherwise directed. The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \n4.7.3.2. Windrow Operations. Operate windrow pickup equipment so that when hot mix is placed in windrows, \nsubstantially all the mixture deposited on the roadbed is picked up and loaded into the paver. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n374 \n4.7.3.3. Hauling Equipment. Use belly dump, live-bottom, or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except \nfor paving miscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD \nwith remixing capability,  or when a thermal imaging system is used, unless otherwise approved. \n4.7.3.4. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than \n5   min. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 346.4.9.3.3.5., “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is stopped. \n4.8. Compaction. Compact the pavement uniformly to contain between 3.7% and 7.0% in-place air voids. Take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the operation within 3.7% and 7.0% when the in-place air voids exceed \nthe range of these tolerances. The Engineer will allow paving to resume when the proposed corrective action \nis likely to yield between 3.7% and 7.0% in-place air voids. \nObtain cores in areas placed under exempt production, as directed, at locations determined by the Engineer. \nThe Engineer may test these cores and suspend operations or require removal and replacement if the \nin-place air voids are less than 2.7% or more than 8.0%. Areas defined in Section 346.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas,” are not subject to in-place air void determination. \nFurnish the type, size, and number of rollers necessary to ensure desired compaction. Use additional rollers \nas required to remove any roller marks. Use only water or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and \nother compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. \nUse the control strip method shown in Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, on the first day of production to establish the \nrolling pattern that will produce the desired in-place air voids,  unless otherwise directed. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures, \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction using rollers. The Engineer may require rolling using \na trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \nComplete all compaction operations before the pavement temperature drops below 180°F,  unless otherwise \nallowed. The Engineer may allow compaction using a light finish roller operated in static mode for pavement \ntemperatures below 180°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan. Payment adjustments for the material will be in accordance with Article 346.6., \n“Payment.” \nSample and test the hot mix on a lot -and-sublot basis. Suspend production if the production payment factor \nshown in Section 346.6.1., “Production Payment\n Adjustment Factors,” or the placement payment factor shown \nin Section 346.6.2., “Placement\n Payment Adjustment Factors,” for two consecutive lots is   below 1.000. \nResume production once test results or other information indicates to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the \nnext material produced or placed will result in payment factors of at least 1.000. \n4.9.1. Referee Testing. The Materials and Tests Division is the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if \nthe differences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference in \naccordance with Table 9 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee \ntesting if the Engineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are \nwithin specification limits. Make the request within 5 working days after receiving test results and cores from \nthe Engineer. Referee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the tests in question. \nAllow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to be \nreported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if more \nthan three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee test \nresults than the Contractor’s test results. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n375 \nThe Materials and Tests Division will determine the laboratory-molded density based on the molded specific \ngravity\n and the maximum theoretical specific gravity of the referee sample. The in-place air voids will be \ndetermined\n based on the bulk-specific gravity of the cores, as determined by the referee laboratory, and the \nEngineer’s\n average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. Except for “ remove and replace” \nconditions, referee test results are final and will establish payment adjustment factors for the sublot in \nquestion. The Contractor may decline referee testing and accept the Engineer’s test results when the \nplacement payment adjustment factor for any sublot results in a    “remove and replace” condition. Placement \nsublots subject to be removed and replaced will be further evaluated in accordance with Section 346.6.2.2., \n“Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement.” \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot. A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 1,000 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 4,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three–four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 1,000 ton and \n4,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \n4.9.2.1.1. Incomplete Production Lots. If a lot is begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of \nproduction or in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Adjust the \npayment for the incomplete lot in accordance with Section 346.6.1., “Production Payment Adjustment \nFactors.” Close all lots within 5 working days unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. Production Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at \nthe plant in accordance with Tex-222-F\n. The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain the custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s testing is completed. \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample. At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F\n. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots.  \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample. For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split,  and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s “blind” sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample. \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must obt\nain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, referee testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n4.9.2.2.2. Informational Methylene Blue Testing. During the project and at random, obtain and provide the Engineer \nwith approximately 50 lb. of each fine aggregate and approximately 20 lb. of all mineral fillers used to \nproduce the mixture. Label the samples with the CSJ number, mixture type, and approximate lot and sublot \nnumbers corresponding to when the sample was taken. The Engineer will ship the samples to the Materials \nand Tests Division for methylene blue testing in accordance with Tex-252-F\n. Results from these tests will not \nbe used for specification compliance. \n4.9.2.2.3. Asphalt Binder Sampling. The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt \nbinder for each lot of mixture produced. The Contractor will notify the Engineer when the sampling will occur. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n376 \nObtain the sample at approximately the same time the mixture random sample is obtained. Sample from a \nport located immediately upstream from the mixing drum or pug mill and upstream from the introduction of \nany additives in accordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part II. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot \nnumbers, producer name, producer facility, grade, District, date sampled, all applicable bills of lading (if \navailable), and project information, including highway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain these \nsamples for 1 yr. The Engineer may also obtain independent samples. If obtaining an independent asphalt \nbinder sample and upon request of the Contractor, the Engineer will split a sample of the asphalt binder with \nthe Contractor. \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of each binder grade and source used. The \nEngineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify compliance with Item 300, \nand will retain the other split sample for 1 yr. \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests in accordance with \nTable 13. The Contractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the \nEngineer. Determine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 9 for all sublots. \nTake immediate corrective action if the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is less than\n 95.0% \nor greater than 97.0% to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may suspend\n operations if \nthe Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. The Engineer will allow\n production to \nresume when the proposed corrective action is   likely to yield acceptable results. \nAt any time during production the Engineer may require the Contractor to verify the following based on\n \nquantities used: \n lime content (within ±0.1% of JMF), when PG binder is specified, \n fiber content (within ±0.03% of JMF), when PG binder is specified,  and \n CRM content (within ±1.5% of JMF), when A-R binder is specified. \nMaintain the in-line measuring device to verify the A-R binder viscosity between 2,500 and 4,000 centipoise \nat 350°F when A-R binder is specified unless otherwise approved. Record A-R binder viscosity at least once \nan hour and provide the Engineer with a daily summary unless otherwise directed. \nThe Engineer may allow alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide \nevidence that results from Tex-236-F, Part I are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate \nmethod unless otherwise directed. Use the applicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method \nis allowed. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n377 \nTable 13 \nProduction and Placement Testing Frequency \nDescription Test Method \nMin Contractor Testing \nFrequency \nMin Engineer Testing Frequency \nIndividual % retained on #8 sieve and \nlarger \nTex-200-F \nor \nTex-236-F\n \n1   per sublot 1 per 12 sublots\n1\n Individual % retained on sieves smaller \nthan #8 and larger than #200 \n% passing #200 sieve \nLaboratory-molded density \nTex-207-F \n– 1 per sublot\n1\n \nLaboratory-molded bulk-specific gravity \nIn-place air voids \nVMA Tex-204-F \nSegregation (density profile) Tex-207-F, Part V 1 per sublot\n2\n 1 per project\n \nLongitudinal joint density Tex-207-F, Part VII 1 per sublot\n3\n 1 per project\n \nMoisture content Tex-212-F, Part II When directed 1 per project \nTheoretical maximum specific (Rice) \ngravity \nTex-227-F – 1 per sublot\n1\n \nDrain-down Tex-235-F 1 per sublot 1 per 12\n \nsublots\n1\n \nAsphalt binder content\n4\n Tex-236-F, Part I 1 per sublot 1 per lot\n1\n \nHamburg wheel test Tex-242-F – 1 per project \nOverlay test\n5\n Tex-248-F – 1 per project \nDeleterious in RAS\n6\n Tex-217-F, Part III – 1 per project \nThermal profile Tex-244-F 1 per sublot\n2\n 1 per project \nAsphalt binder sampling and testing\n6,7 \nTex-500-C – \n1 per project \nTack coat sampling and testing Tex-500-C, Part III – \nBoil test\n8\n Tex-530-C 1 per lot \nMethylene blue test\n9\n Tex-252-F – \nShear bond strength test\n10\n Tex-249-F – \n1. For production defined in Section 346.4.9.4., “Exempt Production,” the Engineer will perform one test per day if 100 ton or more is \nproduced. For exempt production, no testing is required when <100 ton is produced. \n2. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer when not using thermal imaging system, unless otherwise approved.  \n3. To be performed in the presence of Engineer. \n4. Ensure the binder content determination excludes fibers. \n5. Use a laboratory listed on the Overlay MPL to test a sample obtained from Lot 2 or higher.   \n6. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or designated laboratory. \n7. Sampling performed by the Contractor. The Engineer will witness sampling and retain the samples for 1 yr. \n8. When shown on the plans. \n9. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division for informational purposes only. \n10. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or District for informational purposes on a sample obtained by the Contractor within \nthe first four lots of the project. \n4.9.2.4. Operational Tolerances. Control the production process within the operational tolerances shown in Table 9. \nWhen production is suspended, the Engineer will allow production to resume when test results or other \ninformation indicates the next mixture produced will be within the operational tolerances. \n4.9.2.4.1. Gradation. Suspend operation and take corrective action if any aggregate is retained on the maximum sieve \nsize shown in Table 7. A sublot is defined as out of tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s test \nresults are out of operational tolerance. Suspend production when test results for gradation exceed the \noperational tolerances shown in Table 9 for three consecutive sublots on the same sieve or four consecutive \nsublots on any sieve, unless otherwise directed. The consecutive sublots may be from more than one lot. \n4.9.2.4.2. Asphalt Binder Content. A sublot is defined as out of operational tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the \nContractor’s test results exceed the values shown in Table 9. No production or placement payment \nadjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that is out of operational tolerance for asphalt \nbinder content. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s asphalt \nbinder content deviates from the current JMF by more than 0.5% for any sublot or is less than the minimum \nasphalt content allowed in accordance with Table 8. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n378 \n4.9.2.4.3. VMAs. The Engineer will determine the VMA for every sublot. For sublots when the Engineer does not \ndetermine asphalt binder content, the Engineer will use the asphalt binder content results from QC testing \nperformed by the Contractor to determine VMA. \nTake immediate corrective action if the VMA value for any sublot is less than the minimum VMA requirement \nfor production shown in Table 7. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA \nresults on two consecutive sublots are below the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in \nTable 7. No production or placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 will be paid for any sublot that \ndoes not meet the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 7 based on the Engineer’s VMA \ndetermination. \nSuspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA result is more than 0.5% below the\n \nminimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 7. In addition to suspending production, the \nEngineer may require removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. \n4.9.2.4.4. Fibers. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if fiber content varies from the design target value \nby more than ±0.03% on two consecutive tests. \n4.9.2.4.5. Hamburg Wheel Test. The Engineer may perform a Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture anytime \nduring production. Suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values when the \nproduction samples fail the Hamburg wheel test criteria shown in Table 8. The Engineer may require up to \nthe entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed and replaced at the \nContractor’s expense. \nIf   the Department-approved laboratory’s Hamburg wheel test results in a “remove and\n replace” condition, the \nContractor may request that the Materials and Tests Division determine the final disposition of the material in \nquestion by re-testing the failing material. \n4.9.2.5. Individual Loads of Hot Mix. The Engineer may reject individual truckloads of hot mix. When a load of hot \nmix is rejected for reasons other than temperature, contamination, or excessive uncoated particles, the \nContractor may request that the rejected load be tested. Make this request within 4 hr. of rejection. The \nEngineer will sample and test the mixture. If test results are within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 9, payment will be made for the load. If test results are not within operational tolerances, no payment \nwill be made for the load. \n4.9.3. Placement Acceptance. \n4.9.3.1. Placement Lot. A placement lot consists of four placement sublots. A placement sublot consists of the area \nplaced during a production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.1. Lot 1 Placement. Placement payment adjustments greater than 1.000 for Lot 1 will be in accordance with \nSection 346.6.2., “Placement Payment Adjustment Factors”; however, no placement adjustment less than \n1.000 will be assessed for any sublot placed in Lot 1 when the in-place air voids are greater than or equal to \n2.7% and less than or equal to 8.0%. Remove and replace any sublot with in-place air voids less than 2.7% \nor greater than 8.0%. \n4.9.3.1.2. Incomplete Placement Lots. An incomplete placement lot consists of the area placed as described in \nSection 346.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” excluding areas defined in Section 346.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas.” Placement sampling is required if the random sample plan for production resulted in \na sample being obtained from an incomplete production sublot. \n4.9.3.1.3. Shoulders, Ramps, Etc. Shoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn \nlanes are subject to in-place air void determination and payment adjustments unless shown on the plans as \nnot eligible for in-place air void determination. Intersections may be considered miscellaneous areas when \ndetermined by the Engineer. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n379 \n4.9.3.1.4. Miscellaneous Areas. Miscellaneous areas include areas that typically involve significant handwork or \ndiscontinuous paving operations, such as temporary detours, driveways, mailbox turnouts, crossovers, \ngores, spot level-up areas, pavement repair sections less than 300 ft., and other similar areas. Temporary \ndetours are subject to in-place air void determination when shown on the plans. Miscellaneous areas also \ninclude level-ups and thin overlays when the layer thickness shown on the plans is less than the minimum \nuntrimmed core height eligible for testing shown in Table 11. The specified layer thickness is based on the \nrate of 110 lb. per square yard for each inch of pavement unless another rate is shown on the plans.  When \n“L evel Up” is listed as part of the bid item description code, a payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be \nassigned for all placement sublots as described in Article 346.6., “Payment.” Miscellaneous areas are not \neligible for random placement sampling locations. Compact miscellaneous areas in accordance with Section \n346.4.8., “Compaction.” Miscellaneous areas are not subject to in-place air void determination, thermal \nprofiles testing, segregation (density profiles), or longitudinal joint density evaluations. \n4.9.3.2. Placement Sampling. The Engineer will select random numbers for all placement sublots at the beginning \nof the project. The Engineer will provide the Contractor with the placement random numbers only \nimmediately after the sublot is completed. Mark the roadway location at the completion of each sublot and \nrecord the station number. Determine one random sample location for each placement sublot in accordance \nwith Tex-225-F\n. Adjust the random sample location by no more than necessary to achieve a 2-ft. clearance if \nthe location is within 2 ft. of a joint or pavement edge. \nShoulders, ramps, intersections, acceleration lanes, deceleration lanes, and turn lanes are always eligible for \nselection as a random sample location; however, if a random sample location falls on one of these areas and \nthe area is shown on the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination, cores will not be taken for \nthe sublot and a 1.000 pay factor will be assigned to that sublot. \nProvide the equipment and means to obtain and trim roadway cores onsite. “Onsite” is defined as in close \nproximity to where the cores are taken. Obtain the cores within 1 working day of the time the placement \nsublot is completed, unless otherwise approved. Obtain two 6-in. diameter cores side-by-side from within 1 ft. \nof the random location provided for the placement sublot. Mark the cores for identification, measure and \nrecord the untrimmed core height, and provide the information to the Engineer. The Engineer will witness the \ncoring operation and measurement of the core thickness. Visually inspect each core and verify that the \ncurrent paving layer is bonded to the underlying layer. Take corrective action if an adequate bond does not \nexist between the current and underlying layer to ensure that an adequate bond will be achieved during \nsubsequent placement operations. \nTrim the cores immediately after obtaining them from the roadway in accordance with Tex-251-F\n if the core \nheights meet the minimum untrimmed value in accordance with Table 11. Trim the cores onsite in the \npresence of the Engineer. Use a permanent marker or paint pen to record the lot and sublot numbers on \neach core, as well as the designation as Core A or Core B. The Engineer may require additional information \nto be marked on the core and may choose to sign or initial the core. The Engineer will take custody of the \ncores immediately after witnessing the trimming of the cores and will retain custody of the cores until the \nDepartment’s testing is completed. Before turning the trimmed cores over to the Engineer, the Contractor \nmay wrap the trimmed cores or secure them in a manner that will reduce the risk of possible damage \noccurring during transport by the Engineer. After testing, the Engineer will return the cores to the Contractor. \nThe Engineer may have the cores transported back to the Department’s laboratory at the HMA plant via the \nContractor’s haul truck or other designated vehicle. In such cases where the cores will be out of the \nEngineer’s possession during transport, the Engineer will use Department-provided security bags and the \nprotocol for Roadway Core Custody protocol located on the Department’s website to provide a secure means \nand process that protect the integrity of the cores during transport. \nDecide whether to include the pair of cores in the air void determination for that sublot if the core height \nbefore trimming is less than the minimum untrimmed value shown in Table 11. Trim the cores as described in \nthe preceding paragraphs before delivering to the Engineer if electing to have the cores included in the air \nvoid determination. If electing to not have the cores included in air void determination, inform the Engineer of \nthe decision and deliver untrimmed cores to the Engineer. The placement pay factor for the sublot will be \n1.000 if cores will not be included in air void determination. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n380 \nInstead of the Contractor trimming the cores onsite immediately after coring, the Engineer and the Contractor \nmay mutually agree to have the trimming operations performed at an alternate location, such as a field \nlaboratory or other similar location. In such cases, the Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately \nafter they are obtained from the roadway and will retain custody of the cores until testing is completed. Either \nthe Department or Contractor representative may perform trimming of the cores. The Engineer will witness all \ntrimming operations in cases where the Contractor representative performs the trimming operation. \nDry the core holes and tack the sides and bottom immediately after obtaining the cores. Fill the hole with the \nsame type of mixture and properly compact the mixture. Repair core holes using other methods when \napproved. \n4.9.3.3. Placement Testing. Perform placement tests in accordance with Table 13. After the Engineer returns the \ncores, the Contractor may test the cores to verify the Engineer’s test results for in-place air voids. The \nallowable differences between the Contractor’s and Engineer’s test results are shown in Table 9. \n4.9.3.3.1. In-Place Air Voids. The Engineer will measure in-place air voids in accordance with Tex-207-F\n and \nTex-227-F. Before drying to a constant weight, cores may be pre-dried using a CoreDry or similar vacuum \ndevice to remove excess moisture. The Engineer will average the values obtained for all sublots in the \nproduction lot to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity. The Engineer will use the average air \nvoid content for in-place air voids. \nThe Engineer will use the vacuum method to seal the core if required in accordance with Tex-207-F. The \nEngineer will use the test results from the unsealed core to determine the placement payment adjustment \nfactor if the sealed core yields a higher specific gravity than the unsealed core. After determining the in-place \nair void content, the Engineer will return the cores and provide test results to the Contractor. \n4.9.3.3.2. Informational Shear Bond Strength Testing. The Engineer will select one random sublot within the first \nfour lots of the project for shear bond strength testing. Obtain full depth cores in accordance with Tex-249-F\n \nunless the HMA is being placed directly on concrete pavement. Label the cores with lot and sublot numbers \nand provide to the Engineer. Inspector must use pertinent Department form to document the CSJ number, \nproducer of the tack coat, mix type, and shot rate. The Engineer will ship the cores to the Materials and Tests \nDivision or District laboratory for shear bond strength testing. Results from these tests will not be used for \nspecification compliance. \n4.9.3.3.3. Segregation (Density Profile). Test for segregation using density profiles in accordance with Tex-207-F, \nPart V. Density profiles are not required and are not applicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nDensity profiles are not applicable in areas described in Section 346.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nPerform at least one density profile per sublot. Perform additional density profiles when any of the following \nconditions occur, unless otherwise approved. \n Areas that are identified by either the Contractor or the Engineer with severe thermal segregation. \n Any visibly segregated areas that exist. \n The paver stops due to lack of material being delivered to the paving operations and the temperature of \nthe uncompacted mat before the initial breakdown rolling is less than the temperatures shown in \nTable 14.  \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n381 \nTable 14 \nMin Uncompacted Mat Temperature Requiring Segregation Profile\n1\n \nHigh-Temperature Binder Grade\n2\n \nMin Temperature of Uncompacted Mat Allowed \nBefore Initial Breakdown Rolling\n3,4,5 \n(°F) \nPG 76 <270 \nA-R binder <270 \n1. Applicable only to paver stops that occur due to lack of material being delivered to the paving \noperations and when not using a thermal imaging system. \n2. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt \nbinder used to produce the mixture. \n3. The surface of the uncompacted mat must be measured using a handheld thermal camera or \ninfrared thermometer. \n4. Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a segregation profile may be reduced 20°F if \nusing a chemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing capabilities, or \npaver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n5. When using WMA, the Min uncompacted mat temperature requiring a segregation profile is \n215°F. \nProvide the Engineer with the density profile of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion \nof each lot. Report the results of each density profile in accordance with Section 346.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nThe density profile is considered failing if it exceeds the tolerances shown in Table 15. When a thermal \nimaging system is not used, the Engineer will measure the density profile at least once per project. The \nEngineer’s density profile results will be used when available. The Engineer may require the Contractor to \nremove and replace the area in question if the area fails the density profile and has surface irregularities as \ndefined in Section 346.4.9.3.3.6., “Irregularities.” The sublot in question may receive a production and \nplacement payment adjustment greater than 1.000, if applicable, when the defective material is successfully \nremoved and replaced. \nInvestigate density profile failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to eliminate \nthe segregation. Suspend production if two consecutive density profiles fail unless otherwise approved. \nResume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \n \nTable 15 \nSegregation (Density Profile) Acceptance Criteria \nMixture Type \nMax Allowable Density Range \n(Highest to Lowest) \nMax Allowable Density Range \n(Average to Lowest) \nSMA-C 8.0 pcf 5.0 pcf \nSMA-D, SMA-F & SMAR-F 6.0 pcf 3.0 pcf \n4.9.3.3.4. Longitudinal Joint Density. \n4.9.3.3.4.1. Informational Tests. Perform joint density evaluations while establishing the rolling pattern and verify that \nthe joint density is no more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at or near the center of the mat. Adjust the \nrolling pattern, if needed, to achieve the desired joint density. Perform additional joint density evaluations,  at \nleast once per sublot,  unless otherwise directed. \n4.9.3.3.4.2. Record Tests. Perform a joint density evaluation for each sublot at each pavement edge that is or will \nbecome a longitudinal joint. Joint density evaluations are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 346.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” Determine the joint density in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, \nPart VII. Record the joint density information and submit results on Department forms to the Engineer. The \nevaluation is considered failing if the joint density is more than 3.0 pcf below the density taken at the core \nrandom sample location and the correlated joint density is less than 90.0%. The Engineer will make \nindependent joint density verification at least once per project and may make independent joint density \nverifications at the random sample locations. The Engineer’s joint density test results will be used when \navailable. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n382 \nProvide the Engineer with the joint density of every sublot in the lot within 1 working day of the completion of \neach lot. Report the results of each joint density in accordance with Section 346.4.2., “Reporting and \nResponsibilities.” \nInvestigate joint density failures and take corrective actions during production and placement to improve the \njoint density. Suspend production if the evaluations on two consecutive sublots fail,  unless otherwise \napproved. Resume production after the Engineer approves changes to production or placement methods. \n4.9.3.3.5. Recovered Asphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The Engineer may take production samples or \ncores from suspect areas of the project to determine recovered asphalt properties. Asphalt binders with an \naging ratio greater than 3.5 do not meet the requirements for recovered asphalt properties and may be \ndeemed defective when tested and evaluated by the Materials and Tests Division. The aging ratio is the DSR \nvalue of the extracted binder divided by the DSR value of the original unaged binder. Obtain DSR values in \naccordance with AASHTO T 315 at the specified high-temperature PG of the asphalt. The Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement of the defective material at the Contractor’s expense. The asphalt binder \nwill be recovered for testing from production samples or cores in accordance with Tex-211-F\n. \n4.9.3.3.6. Irregularities. Identify and correct irregularities,  including segregation, rutting, raveling, flushing, fat spots, \nmat slippage, irregular color, irregular texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, uncoated aggregate \nparticles, or broken aggregate particles. The Engineer may also identify irregularities, and in such cases, the \nEngineer will promptly notify the Contractor. If the Engineer determines that the irregularity will adversely \naffect pavement performance, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace (at the \nContractor’s expense) areas of the pavement that contain irregularities. The Engineer may also require the \nContractor to remove and replace (at the Contractor’s expense) areas where the mixture does not bond to \nthe existing pavement.  \nIf irregularities are detected, the Engineer may require the Contractor to immediately suspend operations or \nmay allow the Contractor to continue operations for no more than one day while the Contractor is taking \nappropriate corrective action. \n4.9.4. Exempt Production. The mixture may be deemed as exempt production when mutually agreed upon \nbetween the Engineer and the Contractor,  or when shown on the plans. Exempt production may be used for \nthe following conditions. \n Anticipated daily production is less than 500 ton. \n Total production for the project is less than 5,000 ton. \n Exempt production is not eligible for referee testing. \n Pavement repair sections are equal to or greater than 300 ft. For pavement repair sections less than \n300 ft., refer to Section 346.4.9.3.1.4., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \nFor exempt production, the Contractor is   relieved of all   production and placement QC and QA sampling and \ntesting\n requirements, except for coring operations when required by the Engineer. When mutually agreed \nupon between the Engineer and the Contractor, production sampling will be allowed at the point of delivery. \nWhen 100 ton or more per day is produced, the Engineer must perform acceptance tests for production and \nplacement in accordance with Table 13. If the specification requirements listed below are met, the \nproduction and placement pay factors are 1.000: \n produce, haul, place, and compact the mixture in compliance with the specification and as directed; \n control mixture production to yield a laboratory-molded density that is within ±1.0% of the target \nlaboratory-molded density as tested by the Engineer; \n compact the mixture in accordance with Section 346.4.8., “Compaction;” \n when a thermal imaging system is not used, the Engineer may perform segregation (density profiles) \nand thermal profiles in accordance with the specification; and \n all other specification requirements. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n383 \n4.9.5. Ride Quality. Measure ride quality in accordance with Item 585, “Ride Quality for Pavement Surfaces,” \nunless otherwise shown on the plans. \n5. MEASUREMENT \n5.1. Stone Matrix Asphalt. Hot mix will be measured by the ton of composite hot mix, which includes asphalt, \naggregate, and additives. Measure the weight on scales in accordance with Item 520. Provide the Engineer \nwith a daily summary of the asphalt mass flow meter readings for SMAR mixtures unless otherwise directed. \n5.2. Tack Coat. Tack coat will be measured at the applied temperature by strapping the tank before and after \nroad application and determining the net volume in gallons from the calibrated distributor. The Engineer will \nwitness all strapping operations for volume determination. All tack, including emulsions, will be measured by \nthe gallon applied. \nThe Engineer may allow the use of a metering device to determine asphalt volume used and application rate \nif the device is accurate within 1.5% of the strapped volume. \n6. PAYMENT \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 346.5.1., “Stone Matrix Asphalt,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Stone Matrix Asphalt” of the \nmixture type, SAC, and binder specified. These prices are full compensation for surface preparation, \nmaterials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \nSection 346.5.2., “Tack Coat,” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Tack Coat” of the tack coat provided. \nThese prices are full compensation for materials, placement, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals. \nPayment adjustments will be applied as determined in accordance with this Item; however, a payment \nadjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned for all placement sublots for level-ups only when “Level Up” is \nlisted as part of the bid item description. A payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to all \nproduction and placement sublots when “Exempt” is listed as part of the bid item description, and all testing \nrequirements are met. \nPayment for each sublot, including applicable payment adjustments greater than 1.000, will be paid only for \nsublots when the Contractor supplies the Engineer with the required documentation for production and \nplacement QC and QA, thermal profiles, segregation density profiles, and longitudinal joint densities in \naccordance with Section 346.4.2., “Reporting and Responsibilities.” When a thermal imaging system is used, \ndocumentation is not required for thermal profiles or segregation density profiles on individual sublots; \nhowever, the thermal imaging system reports described in Tex-244-F\n are required. \nTrial batches will not be paid for unless they are included in pavement work approved by the Department. \nPayment adjustment for ride quality will be determined in accordance with Item 585. \n6.1. Production Payment Adjustment Factors. The production payment adjustment factor is based on the \nlaboratory-molded density using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk-specific gravities of the samples from \neach sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s maximum theoretical specific gravity for the sublot. The \nindividual sample densities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the production payment adjustment \nfactor shown in Table 16 for each sublot, using the deviation from the target laboratory-molded density \nshown in Table 8. The production payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the average of the \npayment adjustment factors for the four sublots sampled within that lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n384 \nTable 16 \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factors for Laboratory-Molded Density\n1 \nAbsolute Deviation from Target \nLaboratory-Molded Density \nProduction Payment Adjustment Factor \n(Target Laboratory-Molded Density) \n0.0 1.100 \n0.1 1.100 \n0.2 1.100 \n0.3 1.086 \n0.4 1.075 \n0.5 1.063 \n0.6 1.050 \n0.7 1.038 \n0.8 1.025 \n0.9 1.013 \n1.0 1.000 \n1.1 0.900 \n1.2 0.800 \n1.3 0.700 \n>1.3 Remove and replace \n1. If the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is <95.0% or >97.0%, take \nimmediate corrective action to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may \nsuspend operations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. \nThe Engineer will allow production to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to \nyield acceptable results. \n6.1.1. Payment for Incomplete Production Lots. Production payment adjustments for incomplete lots, described \nunder Section 346.4.9.2.1.1., “Incomplete Production Lots,” will be calculated using the average production \npayment factors from all sublots sampled.  \nA production payment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot    when the\n random sampling plan did not result \nin collection of any samples within the first sublot. \n6.1.2. Production Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the laboratory-molded \ndensity for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as shown in Table 13, the Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer \nmay also accept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized \nWork.” Replacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in accordance with this \nSection. \n6.2. Placement Payment Adjustment Factors. The placement payment adjustment factor is based on in-place \nair voids using the Engineer’s test results. The bulk-specific gravities of the cores from each sublot will be \ndivided by the Engineer’s average maximum theoretical specific gravity for the lot. The individual core \ndensities for the sublot will be averaged to determine the placement payment adjustment factor in \naccordance with Table 17 for each sublot that requires in-place air void measurement. A placement payment \nadjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to the entire sublot when the random sample location falls in an \narea shown on the plans as not subject to in-place air void determination. A placement payment adjustment \nfactor of 1.000 will be assigned to quantities placed in areas described in Section 346.4.9.3.1.4., \n“Miscellaneous Areas.” The placement payment adjustment factor for completed lots will be the average of \nthe placement payment adjustment factors for up to four sublots within that lot. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n385 \nTable 17 \nPlacement Payment Adjustment Factors for In-Place Air Voids \nIn-Place  \nAir Voids \nPlacement Payment \nAdjustment Factor \nIn-Place  \nAir Voids \nPlacement Payment \nAdjustment Factor \n<2.7 Remove and replace 5.4 1.080 \n2.7 0.710 5.5 1.075 \n2.8 0.740 5.6 1.070 \n2.9 0.770 5.7 1.065 \n3.0 0.800 5.8 1.060 \n3.1 0.830 5.9 1.055 \n3.2 0.860 6.0 1.050 \n3.3 0.890 6.1 1.045 \n3.4 0.920 6.2 1.040 \n3.5 0.950 6.3 1.035 \n3.6 0.980 6.4 1.030 \n3.7 1.010 6.5 1.025 \n3.8 1.040 6.6 1.020 \n3.9 1.070 6.7 1.015 \n4.0 1.100 6.8 1.010 \n4.1 1.100 6.9 1.005 \n4.2 1.100 7.0 1.000 \n4.3 1.100 7.1 0.970 \n4.4 1.100 7.2 0.940 \n4.5 1.100 7.3 0.910 \n4.6 1.100 7.4 0.880 \n4.7 1.100 7.5 0.850 \n4.8 1.100 7.6 0.820 \n4.9 1.100 7.7 0.790 \n5.0 1.100 7.8 0.760 \n5.1 1.095 7.9 0.730 \n5.2 1.090 8.0 0.700 \n5.3 1.085 >8.0 Remove and replace \n6.2.1. Payment for Incomplete Placement Lots. Payment adjustments for incomplete placement lots described \nunder Section 346.4.9.3.1.2., “Incomplete Placement Lots,” will be calculated using the average of the \nplacement pay factors from all sublots sampled and sublots where the random location falls in an area shown \non the plans as not eligible for in-place air void determination.  \nIf the random sampling plan results in production samples, but not in placement samples, the random core \nlocation and placement adjustment factor for the sublot will be determined by applying the placement random \nnumber to the length of the sublot placed. \nIf the random sampling plan results in placement samples, but not in production samples, no placement \nadjustment factor will apply for that sublot placed. \nA placement payment adjustment factor of 1.000 will be assigned to any lot when the random sampling plan \ndid not result in collection of any production samples. \n6.2.2. Placement Sublots Subject to Removal and Replacement. If after referee testing the placement payment \nadjustment factor for any sublot results in a “remove and replace” condition as shown in Table 17, the \nEngineer will choose the location of two cores to be taken within 3 ft. of the original failing core location. The \nContractor must obtain the cores in the presence of the Engineer. The Engineer will take immediate \npossession of the untrimmed cores and submit the untrimmed cores to the Materials and Tests Division, \nwhere they will be trimmed, if necessary, and tested for bulk-specific gravity within 10 working days of \nreceipt.  \nThe bulk-specific gravity of each core from each sublot will be divided by the Engineer’s average maximum \ntheoretical specific  gravity for that lot. The individual core densities for the sublot will be averaged to \ndetermine the new payment adjustment factor of the sublot in question. If   the new  payment adjustment factor \n\n2024 Specifications  346 \n386 \nis 0.700 or greater, the new payment adjustment factor will apply to that sublot. If   the new payment \nadjustment factor is less than 0.700, no payment will be made for the sublot. Remove  and replace the failing \nsublot, or the Engineer may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. The Engineer may also \naccept the sublot in accordance with Section 5.3.1., “Acceptance of Defective or Unauthorized Work.” \nReplacement material meeting the requirements of this Item will be paid for in  accordance with this Section. \n6.3. Total Adjusted Pay (TAP) Calculation. TAP will be based on the applicable payment adjustment factors for \nproduction and placement for each lot. \nTAP = (A+B)/2 \nwhere: \nA = Bid price × production lot quantity × average payment adjustment factor for the production lot \nB = Bid price × placement lot quantity × average payment adjustment factor for the placement lot + (bid price \n× quantity placed in miscellaneous areas × 1.000) \nProduction lot quantity = Quantity actually placed - quantity left in place without payment \nPlacement lot quantity = Quantity actually placed - quantity left in place without payment - quantity placed in \nmiscellaneous areas \n \n \n \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n387 \n \nItem 347 \nThin Overlay Mixtures \n1. DESCRIPTION \nConstruct a thin surface course composed of a compacted mixture of aggregate, asphalt binder, and \nadditives mixed hot in a mixing plant. Produce a thin overlay mixture (TOM) with a minimum lift thickness of \n1/2 in. for a Type F mixture and 3/4 in. for a Type C mixture. \n2. MATERIALS \nFurnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality that meet the requirements of the plans and \nspecifications. \nNotify the Engineer of all material sources and before changing any material source or formulation. The \nEngineer will verify that the specification requirements are met and document all material source changes \nwhen the Contractor makes a source or formulation change. The Engineer may sample and test project \nmaterials anytime during the project to verify specification compliance in accordance with Item 6, “Control of \nMaterials.” \n2.1. Aggregate.  Furnish aggregates from sources that conform to the requirements shown in Table 1 and this \nSection. Aggregate requirements in this Section, including those shown in Table 1, may be\n modified or \neliminated when shown on the plans. Additional aggregate requirements may be specified when\n shown on \nthe plans. Provide aggregate stockpiles that meet the definitions in this Section for coarse,\n intermediate, or \nfine aggregate. Do not use reclaimed asphalt pavement or recycled asphalt shingles.  Supply aggregates that \nmeet the definitions in Tex-100-E\n for crushed gravel or crushed stone. The Engineer will designate the plant \nor the quarry as the sampling location. Provide samples from materials produced for the project. The \nEngineer will establish the Surface Aggregate Classification (SAC) and perform\n Los Angeles abrasion, \nmagnesium sulfate soundness, and Micro-Deval tests. Perform all other aggregate\n quality tests in \naccordance with Table 1. Document all test results in the mixture design report. The Engineer may\n perform \ntests on independent or split samples to verify Contractor test results. Stockpile aggregates for each\n source \nand type separately. Determine aggregate gradations for mixture design and production testing based\n on the \nwashed sieve analysis in accordance with \nTex-200-F,  Part II. \n2.1.1. Coarse Aggregate. Coarse aggregate stockpiles must have no more than 20% material passing the No. 8 \nsieve. Aggregates from sources listed in the Department’s Bituminous Rated Source Quality Catalog \n(BRSQC), are preapproved for use. Use only the rated values for hot mix listed in the BRSQC. Rated values \nfor surface treatment do not apply to coarse aggregate sources used in hot-mix asphalt. \nFor sources not listed in the Department’s BRSQC: \n build an individual stockpile for each material; \n request the Department test the stockpile for specification compliance; \n allow 30 calendar days for the Engineer to sample, test, and report results; \n use only when tested and approved; and \n once approved, do not add additional material to the stockpile unless otherwise allowed by the \nEngineer. \nProvide coarse aggregate with at least the minimum SAC shown on the plans. SAC requirements apply only \nto aggregates used on the surface of travel lanes, unless otherwise shown on the plans. The SAC for \nsources in the Department’s Aggregate Quality Monitoring Program (AQMP) (Tex-499-A\n) is listed in the \nBRSQC. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n388 \n2.1.1.1. Blending Class A and Class B Aggregates. Class B aggregate meeting all other requirements shown in \nTable 1 may be blended with a Class A aggregate to meet requirements for Class A materials, unless \notherwise shown on the plans. When blending Class A and Class B aggregates to meet a Class A \nrequirement, ensure that at least 50% by weight, or volume if required, of the material retained on the No. 8 \nsieve comes from the Class A aggregate source, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Blend by volume if \nthe bulk specific gravities of the Class A and Class B aggregates differ by more than 0.300. Class B \naggregate may be disallowed when shown on the plans. \nThe Engineer may perform tests anytime during production, when the Contractor blends Class A and Class B \naggregates to meet a Class A requirement. The Engineer will use the Department’s mix design template, \nwhen electing to verify conformance, to calculate the percent of Class A aggregate retained on the No. 4 \nsieve by inputting the bin percentages shown from readouts in the control room at the time of production and \nstockpile gradations measured at the time of production. The Engineer may determine the gradations based \non either washed or dry sieve analysis from samples obtained from individual aggregate cold feed bins or \naggregate stockpiles. The Engineer may perform spot checks to verify the percent of Class A aggregate \nretained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer will use the gradations supplied by the Contractor in the mixture \ndesign report as an input for the template. A failing spot check will require confirmation with a stockpile \ngradation determined by the Engineer. \n2.1.1.2. Micro-Deval Abrasion. The Engineer will perform at least one Micro-Deval abrasion test in accordance with \nTex-461-A\n for each coarse aggregate source used in the mixture design that has a Rated Source Soundness \nMagnesium (RSSM) loss value greater than 15 as listed in the BRSQC. The Engineer will perform testing \nbefore the start of production and may perform additional testing anytime during production. The Engineer \nmay obtain the coarse aggregate samples from each coarse aggregate source or may require the Contractor \nto obtain the samples. The Engineer may waive all Micro-Deval testing based on a satisfactory test history of \nthe same aggregate source. \nThe Engineer will estimate the magnesium sulfate soundness loss for each coarse aggregate source, when \ntested, using the following formula: \nMgest. = (RSSM)(MDact./RSMD) \nwhere: \nMgest. = magnesium sulfate soundness loss \nRSSM = rated source soundness magnesium \nMDact = actual Micro-Deval percent loss  \nRSMD = rated source Micro-Deval \nWhen the estimated magnesium sulfate soundness loss is greater than the maximum magnesium sulfate \nsoundness loss specified, the coarse aggregate source will not be allowed for use unless otherwise \napproved. The Engineer will consult the Materials and Tests Division, and additional testing may be required \nbefore granting approval. \n2.1.2. Intermediate Aggregate. Aggregates not meeting the definition of coarse or fine aggregate will be defined \nas intermediate aggregate. Supply intermediate aggregates, when used, that are free of organic impurities. \nSupply intermediate aggregate from coarse aggregate sources, when used that meet the requirements \nshown in Table 1 unless otherwise approved. \nTest the stockpile if 10% or more of the stockpile is retained on the No. 4 sieve, and verify that it meets the \nrequirements shown in Table 1 for crushed face count (in accordance with Tex-460-A\n) and flat and elongated \nparticles (in accordance with Tex-280-F). \n2.1.3. Fine Aggregate. Fine aggregates consist of manufactured sands and screenings. Natural sands are not \nallowed in any mixture.

May be obtained from asphalt meter readouts as determined by the Engineer. \n6. Binder content is  not allowed to be outside the limits shown in Table 6.  \n7. Verify that Table 6 requirements are met. \n8. Verify that Table 7 requirements are met. \n4.4.2.2. Engineer’s Responsibilities. \n4.4.2.2.1. Superpave Gyratory Compactor. The Engineer will use a Department SGC, calibrated in accordance with \nTex-241-F\n, to mold samples for laboratory mixture design verification. For molding trial batch and production \nspecimens, the Engineer will use the Contractor-provided SGC at the field laboratory or provide and use a \nDepartment SGC at an alternate location. \n4.4.2.2.2. Conditional Approval of JMF1 and Authorizing Trial Batch. The Engineer will review and verify \nconformance of the following information within 2 working days of receipt. \n the Contractor’s mix design report (JMF1); \n the Department-provided overlay test results; \n the Contractor-provided Hamburg wheel test results; \n all required materials including aggregates, asphalt, and additives; and \n the mixture specifications. \nThe Engineer will grant the Contractor conditional approval of JMF1 if the information provided on the paper \ncopy of JMF1 indicates that the Contractor’s mixture design meets the specifications. When the Contractor \ndoes not provide Hamburg wheel test results with laboratory mixture design, 10 working days are allowed for \nconditional approval of JMF1. The Engineer will base full approval of JMF1 on test results on mixture from \nthe trial batch. \nUnless waived, the Engineer will determine the Micro-Deval abrasion loss in accordance with \nSection 347.2.1.1.2., “Micro-Deval Abrasion.” If the Engineer’s test results are pending after 2 working days, \nconditional approval of JMF1 will still be granted within 2 working days of receiving JMF1. When the \nEngineer’s test results become available, they will be used for specification compliance. \nThe Contractor is authorized to produce a trial batch after the Engineer grants conditional approval of JMF1. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n398 \n4.4.2.2.3. Hamburg Wheel and Overlay Testing of JMF1. If the Contractor requests the option to have the \nDepartment perform the Hamburg Wheel test on the laboratory mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in \naccordance with Tex-242-F\n to verify compliance with the Hamburg Wheel test requirement shown in Table 7. \nThe Engineer will perform the overlay test and mold samples in accordance with Tex-248-F to verify \ncompliance with the overlay test requirements shown in Table 7. Upon receiving the sample from the \nContractor, the Engineer will be allowed 10 working days to provide the Contractor with Hamburg wheel and \noverlay test results on the laboratory mixture design. \n4.4.2.2.4. Ignition Oven Correction Factors. The Engineer will determine ignition oven correction factors by one of \nthe following options. \n Witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples by the Contractor in accordance with \nTex-236-F\n, Part. II. The Engineer will use the identically prepared samples provided by the Contractor to \ndetermine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in accordance with \nTex-236-F, Part III. \n If the Engineer does not witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples, the Engineer will \nprepare the samples to determine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in \naccordance with Tex-236-F, Part II. Notify the Contractor before performing Tex-236-F\n, Part II. Allow the \nContractor to witness the Engineer performing Tex-236-F, Part II. \nCorrection factors must be performed every 12 mo. to be used for QA testing during production. \n4.4.2.2.5. Testing the Trial Batch. Within 1 full working day, the Engineer will sample and test the trial batch to ensure \nthat the mixture meets the requirements shown in Table 8. If the Contractor requests the option to have the \nDepartment perform the Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in \naccordance with Tex-242-F\n to verify compliance with Hamburg wheel test requirements shown in Table 7. \nThe Engineer will mold samples for the overlay test in accordance with Tex-248-F to verify compliance with \nthe overlay test requirement shown in Table 7. \nThe Engineer will have the option to perform Tex-530-C on the trial batch when shown on the plans. These \nresults may be retained and used for comparison purposes during production. \n4.4.2.2.6. Full Approval of JMF1. The Engineer will grant full approval of JMF1 and authorize the Contractor to \nproceed with developing JMF2 if the Engineer’s results for the trial batch meet the requirements shown in \nTable 6 and Table 7. The Engineer will notify the Contractor that an additional trial batch is required if the trial \nbatch does not meet these requirements. \n4.4.2.2.7. Approval of JMF2. The Engineer will approve JMF2 within 1 working day if the mixture meets the \nrequirements shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. \n4.4.2.2.8. Approval of Lot 1 Production. The Engineer will authorize the Contractor to proceed with JMF2 for Lot 1 \nproduction after passing test results on the trial batch are achieved from laboratories listed on the Hamburg \nwheel MPL and overlay MPL. The Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the \nresults from the Hamburg wheel test or overlay test on the trial batch. \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s sample from the trial batch fails the Hamburg wheel test or overlay \ntest, the Engineer will suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests or overlay tests meet the \nspecified values. The Engineer may require up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel \ntest or overlay test to be removed and replaced at the Contractor’s expense. \n4.4.2.2.9. Approval of JMF3 and Subsequent JMF Changes. JMF3 and subsequent JMF changes are approved if \nthey meet the master gradation limits and asphalt binder content in accordance with Table 6 and are within \nthe operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 8. The addition of a warm-mix asphalt (WMA) additive to \nfacilitate mixing or as a compaction aid does not require a new laboratory mixture design or trial batch. \nCurrent JMF changes that exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 in accordance with Table 8 may \nrequire a new laboratory mixture design, trial batch, or both. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n399 \n4.5. Production Operations. Perform a new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All asphalt \nsource changes will require a passing Hamburg wheel result from a laboratory listed on the MPL. The \nContractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg wheel \ntest on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and trial \nbatch. Take corrective action and receive approval to proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials. Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \naccordance with Item 300, or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the Engineer with \ndaily records of asphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible increments) in \naccordance with Item 320, unless otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a period long enough to affect \nthe quality of the mixture, nor in any case longer than 12 hr., unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperatures shown in Table 9. The Department will \nnot pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperatures shown \nin Table 9. \nTable 9 \nMax Production Temperature \nHigh-Temperature Binder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 76 345\n \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature grade of \nthe virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture. \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all moisture is removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F\n, Part II, and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n4.6. Hauling Operations. Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is not contaminated. Use a \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 347.4.7.3.3., “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations. Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide \nthe Department’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a hand-held thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is not used, to measure and record the \ninternal temperature of the mixture as discharged from the truck or material transfer device (MTD) before or \nas the mix enters the paver. Measure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, \nor as approved. Include an approximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the \nlocation where the temperature was taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixtures meets the temperature \nrequirements shown in Table 9. Calculate the daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift and provide \nto the Engineer at the end of paving operations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer may \nsuspend production if the Contractor fails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by the \nend of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material, such as moisture, \ndirt, sand, leaves, and other loose impediments, from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation \nfrom pavement edges. Place the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, \nfinished surface with a uniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of \nhot mix by at least 6 in. Place mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6 in. of \nlane lines, are not placed in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as directed. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n400 \nEnsure that all finished surfaces will drain properly. Place the mixture at the rate or thickness shown on the \nplans. The Engineer will use the guidelines shown in Table 10 to determine the compacted lift thickness. The \nthickness determined is based on the rate of 110–115 lb. per square yard for each inch of pavement unless \notherwise shown on the plans. \n \nTable 10 \nCompacted Lift T hickness \nMixture Type\n Min (in.) Max (in.) \nTOM-C 0.75 1.25 \nTOM-F 0.5 1.00 \n4.7.1. Weather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a Thermal Imaging System. Place mixture when the roadway is dry and the roadway surface \ntemperature is at or above 60°F, unless otherwise approved or as shown on the plans. Place mixtures only \nwhen weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by the \nEngineer. Provide output data from the thermal imaging system to demonstrate to the Engineer that no \nrecurring severe thermal segregation exists in accordance with Section 347.4.7.3.1.2., “Thermal Imaging \nSystem.” \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to \nfacilitate compaction when the air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or above 70°F, unless otherwise \napproved or as shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature using a handheld thermal \ncamera or infrared thermometer. Place mixtures only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the \nroadway surface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. The Engineer may restrict the Contractor from \npaving if the air temperature is 70°F and falling. \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to \nfacilitate compaction when the air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.2. Tack Coat.  \n4.7.2.1. Application. Clean the surface before placing the tack coat. The Engineer will set the rate between 0.04 gal. \nand 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. Apply a uniform tack coat at the specified \nrate unless otherwise directed. Apply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular \npatterns. Apply the tack coat to all surfaces that will come in contact with the subsequent HMA placement, \nunless otherwise directed. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in the longitudinal direction during \nplacement of the mat to ensure bond of adjacent mats, unless otherwise directed. Allow adequate time for \nemulsion to break completely before placing any material. Prevent splattering of tack coat when placed \nadjacent to curb, gutter, and structures. The Engineer may suspend paving operations until there is adequate \ncoverage. Do not dilute emulsified asphalts at the terminal, in the field, or at any other location before use \nunless required in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendation for approved TRAIL products on \nthe MPL. \n4.7.2.2. Sampling. The Engineer will obtain at least one sample of the tack coat binder per project per source in \naccordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part III, and test it in accordance with Item 300. The Engineer will notify the \nContractor when the sampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample from the asphalt \ndistributor immediately before use. Label the can with the corresponding lot and sublot numbers; producer; \nproducer facility location; grade; District; date sampled; all applicable bills of lading (if available); and project \ninformation, including highway and CSJ number. For emulsions, the Engineer may test as often as \nnecessary to ensure the residual of the emulsion is greater than or equal to the specification requirement in \nItem 300. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n401 \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperatures shown in Table 11 to establish the minimum \nplacement temperature of mixture delivered to the paving operation. \n \nTable 11 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3 \n(F°) \nPG 76 280 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature \ngrade of the virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture.  \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld \nthermal camera or infrared thermometer immediately before \nentering MTD or paver. \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a \nchemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with re-mixing \ncapabilities, or paver hopper insert with re-mixing capabilities. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile. Use a handheld thermal camera or a thermal imaging system to obtain a continuous \nthermal profile in accordance with Tex-244-F\n. Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 347.4.9.3.2., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.1.1. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.1.1.1. Moderate. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.1.2. Severe. Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.1.2. Thermal Imaging System. Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F\n to the Engineer daily, unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system.  \nThe Engineer may suspend paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the paving \nprocess to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested. \n4.7.3.1.3. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the thermal images generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 347.4.2., “Reporting \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used. Evaluate areas with moderate thermal segregation by performing water flow testing \nin accordance with Tex-246-F\n, and verify the water flow is greater than 120 sec. \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. Evaluate areas with severe thermal segregation by performing water flow \ntesting in accordance with Tex-246-F\n, and verify the water flow is greater than 120 sec. Remove and replace \nthe material in any areas that have severe thermal segregation and a failing result for water flow test unless \notherwise directed. \n4.7.3.2. Windrow Operations. Operate windrow pickup equipment so that when hot mix is placed in windrows, \nsubstantially all the mixture deposited on the roadbed is picked up and loaded into the paver. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n402 \n4.7.3.3. Hauling Equipment. Use belly dump, live-bottom, or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except \nfor paving miscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD \nwith remixing capability, unless otherwise approved. \n4.7.3.4. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than 5 \nmin. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 347.4.9.3.3., “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is stopped. \n4.8. Compaction. Roll the freshly placed mixture using as many steel-wheeled rollers as necessary to ensure \ndesired compaction without excessive breakage of the aggregate, and to provide a smooth surface and \nuniform texture. Operate each roller in static mode for TOM-F mixtures only. Do not use pneumatic rollers. \nUse the control strip method in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, to establish the rolling pattern. \nThoroughly moisten the roller drums with a soap and water solution to prevent adhesion. Use only water or \nan approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. \nUse tamps to thoroughly compact the edges of the pavement along curbs, headers, and similar structures, \nand in locations that will not allow thorough compaction using rollers. The Engineer may require rolling using \na trench roller on widened areas, in trenches, and in other limited areas. \nTest and verify that the compacted mixture meets the water flow requirements in accordance with Tex-246-F\n. \nMeasure the water flow once per sublot at locations as directed by the Engineer. The water flow rate must be \ngreater than 120 sec. Investigate the cause of the water flow rate test failures and take corrective actions \nduring production and placement to ensure the water flow rate is greater than 120 sec. Suspend production if \ntwo consecutive water flow rate tests fail, unless otherwise approved. Resume production after the Engineer \napproves changes to production or placement methods.  \nMeasure water flow to verify the mixture is adequately compacted at confined longitudinal joints in \naccordance with Tex-246-F\n as directed by the Engineer. \nComplete all compaction operations before the pavement temperature drops below 180°F, unless otherwise \nallowed. The Engineer may allow compaction using a light finish roller operated in static mode for pavement \ntemperatures below 180°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic, unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan. Sample and test the HMA on a lot-and-sublot basis.  \n4.9.1. Referee Testing. The Materials and Tests Division is the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if \nthe differences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference \nshown in Table 8 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee testing if \nthe Engineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are within \nspecification limits. Make the request within 5 working days after receiving test results from the Engineer. \nReferee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the particular tests in question. \nAllow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to be \nreported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if more \nthan three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee test \nresults than the Contractor’s test results. \nThe Materials and Tests Division will determine the laboratory-molded density based on the molded specific \ngravity and the maximum theoretical specific gravity of the referee sample. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n403 \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot. A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 500 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 2,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three or four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 500 ton and \n2,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \n4.9.2.1.1. Incomplete Production Lots. If a lot is begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of \nproduction or in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Close all lots \nwithin 5 working days unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. Production Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at \nthe plant in accordance with Tex-222-F\n. The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain the custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s testing is completed. \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample. At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F\n. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots. \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample. For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split, and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s blind sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample. \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must obtain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, referee testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n4.9.2.2.2. Informational Methylene Blue Testing. During the project and at random, obtain and provide the Engineer \nwith approximately 50 lb. of each fine aggregate and approximately 20 lb. of all mineral fillers used to \nproduce the mixture. Label the samples with the CSJ number, mixture type, and approximate lot and sublot \nnumber corresponding to when the sample was taken. The Engineer will ship the samples to the Materials \nand Tests Division for methylene blue testing in accordance with Tex-252-F\n. Results from these tests will not \nbe used for specification compliance. \n4.9.2.2.3. Asphalt Binder Sampling. The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt \nbinder for each lot of mixture produced. The Contractor must notify the Engineer when the sampling will \noccur. Obtain the sample at approximately the same time the mixture random sample is obtained. Sample \nfrom a port located immediately upstream from the mixing drum or pug mill and upstream from the \nintroduction of any additives in accordance with Tex-500-C\n, Part II. Label the can with the corresponding lot \nand sublot numbers, producer, producer facility location, grade District date sampled, all applicable bills of \nlading (if available), and project information, including highway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain \nthese samples for 1 yr. The Engineer may also obtain independent samples. If obtaining an independent \nasphalt binder sample and upon request of the Contractor, the Engineer will split a sample of the asphalt \nbinder with the Contractor.  \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n404 \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of each binder grade and source used. The \nEngineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify compliance with Item 300, \nand will retain the other split sample for 1 yr. \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests shown in Table 12. The \nContractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the Engineer. \nDetermine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 8 for all sublots. \nTake immediate corrective action if the Engineer’s laboratory-molded density on any sublot is less than \n95.0% or greater than 98.0% to bring the mixture within these tolerances. The Engineer may suspend \noperations if the Contractor’s corrective actions do not produce acceptable results. The Engineer will allow \nproduction to resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to yield acceptable results. \nThe Engineer may allow alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide \nevidence that results from Tex-236-F, Part I are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate \nmethod unless otherwise directed. Use the applicable test procedure as directed if an alternate test method \nis allowed. \nTable 12 \nProduction and Placement Testing Frequency \nDescription Test Method \nMin  Contractor Testing \nFrequency \nMin Engineer Testing \nFrequency \nIndividual % retained on #8 sieve and larger \nTex-200-F or \nTex-236-F \n1 per sublot 1 per 12 sublots\n \nIndividual % retained on sieves smaller than   \n#8 and larger than #200 \n% passing the #200 sieve \nLaboratory-molded density \nTex-207-F \n– \n1 per sublot \nLaboratory-molded bulk-specific gravity \nVMA Tex-204-F \nMoisture content Tex-212-F, Part II When directed \nTheoretical maximum specific (Rice) gravity Tex-227-F, Part II – 1 per sublot \nAsphalt binder content\n1\n Tex-236-F, Part I 1 per sublot 1 per lot \nOverlay test\n2\n Tex-248-F – 1 per project \nHamburg wheel test Tex-242-F – 1 per project \nThermal profile Tex-244-F 1 per sublot\n3\n 1 per project \nAsphalt binder sampling and testing\n4,5\n \nTex-500-C, Part II – \n1 per project \nTack coat sampling and testing Tex-500-C, Part III – \nBoil test\n6\n Tex-530-C 1 per sublot \nWater flow test\n7\n Tex-246-F 1 per sublot \nMethylene blue test\n8\n Tex-252-F – \n1.

The Engineer will retain these samples for 1 yr. \n5. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division or designated laboratory. \n6. When shown on the plans. \n7. To be performed in the presence of the Engineer, unless otherwise directed. \n8. Testing performed by the Materials and Tests Division for informational purposes only. \n4.9.2.4. Operational Tolerances. Control the production process within the operational tolerances in accordance \nwith Table 8. When production is suspended, the Engineer will allow production to resume when test results \nor other information indicates the next mixture produced will be within the operational tolerances. \n4.9.2.4.1. Gradation. Suspend operation and take corrective action if any aggregate is retained on the maximum sieve \nsize shown in Table 6. A sublot is defined as out of tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the Contractor’s test \nresults are out of operational tolerance. Suspend production when test results for gradation exceed the \noperational tolerances shown in Table 8 for three consecutive sublots on the same sieve or four consecutive \nsublots on any sieve, unless otherwise directed. The consecutive sublots may be from more than one lot. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n405 \n4.9.2.4.2. Asphalt Binder Content. A sublot is defined as out of operational tolerance if either the Engineer’s or the \nContractor’s test results exceed the values in accordance with Table 8. Suspend production when two or \nmore sublots within a lot are out of operational tolerance or below the minimum asphalt binder content shown \nin Table 6 unless otherwise directed. Suspend production and shipment of mixture if the Engineer’s or \nContractor’s asphalt binder content deviates from the current JMF by more than 0.5% for any sublot or is less \nthan the minimum asphalt content allowed shown in Table 6. \n4.9.2.4.3. VMA. The Engineer will determine the VMA for every sublot. For sublots when the Engineer does not \ndetermine asphalt binder content, the Engineer will use the asphalt binder content results from QC testing \nperformed by the Contractor to determine VMA. \nTake immediate corrective action if the VMA value for any sublot is less than the minimum VMA requirement \nfor production shown in Table 6. Suspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA \nresults on two consecutive sublots are below the minimum VMA requirement for production shown in \nTable 6. \nSuspend production and shipment of the mixture if the Engineer’s VMA result is more than 0.5% below the \nminimum VMA requirement for production shown in Table 6. In addition to suspending production, the \nEngineer may require removal and replacement or may allow the sublot to be left in place without payment. \n4.9.2.4.4. Hamburg Wheel Test. The Engineer may perform a Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture at any \ntime during production. Suspend production until further Hamburg wheel tests meet the specified values \nwhen the production samples fail the Hamburg wheel test criteria shown in Table 7. The Engineer may \nrequire up to the entire sublot of any mixture failing the Hamburg wheel test to be removed and replaced at \nthe Contractor’s expense. \nIf the Department-approved laboratory’s Hamburg wheel test on plant-produced mixture results in a “remove \nand replace” condition, the Contractor may request that the Materials and Tests Division determine the final \ndisposition of the material in question by re-testing the failing material. \n4.9.2.5. Individual Loads of Hot Mix. The Engineer may reject individual truckloads of hot mix. When a load of hot \nmix is rejected for reasons other than temperature, contamination, or excessive uncoated particles, the \nContractor may request that the rejected load be tested. Make this request within 4 hr. of rejection. The \nEngineer will sample and test the mixture. If test results are within the operational tolerances shown in Table \n8, payment will be made for the load. If test results are not within operational tolerances, no payment will be \nmade for the load. \n4.9.3. Placement Acceptance. \n4.9.3.1. Placement Lot. A placement lot consists of four placement sublots. A placement sublot consists of the area \nplaced during a production sublot. \n4.9.3.2. Miscellaneous Areas.

The specified layer thickness is based on the rate of 110–115 lb. per square yard \nfor each inch of pavement, unless another rate is shown on the plans. Miscellaneous areas are not subject to \nthermal profiles or water flow testing. \n4.9.3.3. Recovered Asphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). The Engineer may take production samples or \ncores from suspect areas of the project to determine recovered asphalt properties. Asphalt binders with an \naging ratio greater than 3.5 do not meet the requirements for recovered asphalt properties and may be \ndeemed defective when tested and evaluated by the Materials and Tests Division. The aging ratio is the DSR \nvalue of the extracted binder divided by the DSR value of the original unaged binder. Obtain DSR values in \naccordance with AASHTO T 315 at the specified high-temperature performance grade of the asphalt. The \nEngineer may require removal and replacement of the defective material at the Contractor’s expense. The \nasphalt binder will be recovered for testing from production samples or cores in accordance with Tex-211-F\n. \n\n2024 Specifications  347 \n406 \n4.9.3.4. Irregularities.

MATERIALS \nFurnish uncontaminated materials of uniform quality that meet the requirements of the plans and \nspecifications. \nNotify the Engineer of all material sources and before changing any material source or formulation. The \nEngineer will verify that the specification requirements are met and document all material source changes \nwhen the Contractor makes a source or formulation change. The Engineer may sample and test project \nmaterials anytime during the project to verify specification compliance in accordance with Item 6, “Control of \nMaterials.” \n2.1. Aggregate. Furnish aggregates from sources that conform to the requirements shown in Table 1 and this \nSection. Aggregate requirements in this Section, including those shown in Table 1, may be\n modified or \neliminated when shown on the plans. Additional aggregate requirements may be specified when\n shown on \nthe plans. Provide aggregate stockpiles that meet the definitions in this Section for coarse or fine\n aggregate. \nDo not use intermediate or fine aggregate in permeable friction course (PFC) mixtures. Supply\n aggregates that \nmeet the definitions in Tex-100-E\n for crushed gravel or crushed stone. The Engineer will designate the plant \nor the quarry as the sampling location. Provide samples from materials produced for the project. The \nEngineer will establish the Surface Aggregate Classification (SAC) and perform Los Angeles\n abrasion, \nmagnesium sulfate soundness, and Micro-Deval tests. Perform all other aggregate quality tests\n shown in \nTable 1. Document all test results in the mixture design report. The Engineer may perform tests on\n \nindependent or split samples to verify Contractor test results. Stockpile aggregates for each source and type \nseparately. Determine aggregate gradations for mixture design and production testing based on the washed \nsieve analysis in accordance with Tex-200-F,  Part II.   \n2.1.1. Coarse Aggregate.  Coarse aggregate stockpiles must have no more than 20% material passing the No. 8 \nsieve. Aggregates from sources listed in the Department’s Bituminous Rated Source Quality Catalog \n(BRSQC)  are preapproved for use. Use only the rated values for HMA listed in the BRSQC. Rated values for \nsurface treatment (ST) do not apply to coarse aggregate sources used in HMA. \nFor sources not listed in the Department’s BRSQC: \n build an individual stockpile for each material; \n request the Department test the stockpile for specification compliance;  \n allow 30 calendar days for the Engineer to sample, test, and report results; \n use only when tested and approved; and \n once approved, do not add material to the stockpile unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. \nProvide coarse aggregate with at least the minimum SAC shown on the plans. SAC requirements apply only \nto aggregates used on the surface of travel lanes, unless otherwise shown on the plans.

Blending Class A and Class B Aggregates. To prevent crushing of the Class B aggregate when blending, \nClass B aggregate may be blended with a    Class A aggregate to meet requirements for Class A materials if: \n the Department’s BRSQC rated source soundness magnesium (RSSM) rating for the Class B aggregate \nis less than the Class A aggregate, or \n the RSSM rating for the Class B aggregate is no more than 10% of the RSSM rating for the Class A \naggregate. \nWhen blending Class A and Class B aggregates to meet a Class A requirement, ensure that at least 50% by \nweight, or volume if required, of the material retained on the No. 4 sieve comes from the Class A aggregate \nsource, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Blend by volume if the bulk-specific gravities of the Class A \nand Class B aggregates differ by more than 0.300. Class B aggregate may be disallowed when shown on the \nplans. \nThe Engineer may perform tests anytime during production, when the Contractor blends Class A and Class B \naggregates to meet a Class A requirement. The Engineer will use the Department’s mix design template, \nwhen electing to verify conformance, to calculate the percent of Class A aggregate retained on the No. 4 \nsieve by inputting the bin percentages shown from readouts in the control room at the time of production and \nstockpile gradations measured at the time of production. The Engineer may determine the gradations based \non either washed or dry sieve analysis from samples obtained from individual aggregate cold feed bins or \naggregate stockpiles. The Engineer may perform spot checks to verify the percent of Class A aggregate \nretained on the No. 4 sieve. The Engineer will use the gradations supplied by the Contractor in the mixture \ndesign report as an input for the template. A failing spot check will require confirmation with a stockpile \ngradation determined by the Engineer. \n2.1.1.2. Micro-Deval Abrasion.

Used to establish baseline for comparison to production results. \n4.4.2. Job-Mix Formula Approval.  The JMF is   the combined aggregate gradation, Ndesign level, and target \nasphalt percentage used to establish target values for hot-mix production. JMF1 is   the original\n laboratory \nmixture design used to produce the trial batch. When a compaction aid or foaming process is   used, JMF1 may \nbe designed and\n submitted to the Engineer without including the compaction aid or foaming process.  When a \ncompaction aid or foaming process is   used, document the compaction aid or foaming\n process used and \nrecommended rate in the JMF1 submittal. The Engineer and the Contractor will verify\n JMF1 based on \nplant-produced mixture from the trial batch, unless otherwise approved. The Engineer may\n accept an existing \nmixture design previously used on a    Department project and may waive the trial batch to\n verify JMF1. The \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n415 \nDepartment may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for verification tests if\n more than two trial \nbatches per design are required. \n4.4.3. Contractor’s Responsibilities. \n4.4.3.1. Providing Superpave Gyratory Compactor.

Apply the correlation factor to all subsequent production \ntest results. \n4.4.3.1.2. Submitting JMF1. Furnish a mix design report (JMF1) with representative samples of all component \nmaterials and request approval to produce the trial batch. Provide an additional 25 lb. of the design mixture if \nopting to have the Department perform the Hamburg wheel test on the laboratory mixture when required in \naccordance with Table 7, and request that the Department perform the test. \n4.4.3.1.3. Supplying Aggregates. Provide approximately 40 lb. of each aggregate stockpile unless otherwise directed. \n4.4.3.1.4. Supplying Asphalt. Provide at least 1 gal. of the asphalt material and enough quantities of any additives \nproposed for use. \n4.4.3.1.5. Ignition Oven Correction Factors. Notify the Engineer before performing Tex-236-F\n, Part II. Allow the \nEngineer to witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor sample. Determine the aggregate and \nasphalt correction factors from the ignition oven in accordance with \nTex-236-F, Part II. Note that the asphalt \ncontent correction factor takes into account the percent fibers in the mixture so that the fibers are excluded \nfrom the binder content determination. \nIf the Engineer witnesses the mixing of the ignition oven correction factors, provide the Engineer with \nidentically prepared samples of the mixtures before the trial batch production, including all additives (except \nwater), and blank samples used to determine the correction factors for the ignition oven used for QA testing \nduring production.  \nCorrection factors established from a previously approved mixture design may be used for the current \nmixture design if the mixture design and ignition oven are the same as previously used, unless otherwise \ndirected. Correction factors must be performed every 12 mo. \n4.4.3.1.6. Boil Test. When shown on the plans, perform the test and retain the tested sample from Tex-530-C\n until \ncompletion of the project or as directed. Use this sample for comparison purposes during production.  \n4.4.3.1.7. Trial Batch Production. Provide a plant-produced trial batch upon receiving conditional approval of JMF1 \nand authorization to produce a trial batch. If applicable, include the compaction aid or foaming process, for \nverification testing of JMF1 and development of JMF2. Produce a trial batch mixture that meets the \nrequirements shown in Table 8. The Engineer may accept test results from recent production of the same \nmixture instead of a new trial batch. \n4.4.3.1.8. Trial Batch Production Equipment. Use only equipment and materials proposed for use on the project to \nproduce the trial batch. Provide documentation to verify the calibration or accuracy of the asphalt mass flow \nmeter to measure the binder content. Verify that asphalt mass flow meter meets the 0.4% accuracy \nrequirement, when applicable, in accordance with Item 520, “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.” The \nEngineer may require that the accuracy of the mass flow meter be verified based on quantities used. \n4.4.3.1.9. Trial Batch Quantity. Produce enough quantity of the trial batch to ensure that the mixture meets the \nspecification requirements. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n416 \n4.4.3.1.10. Number of Trial Batches. Produce trial batches as necessary to obtain a mixture that meets the \nspecification requirements. \n4.4.3.1.11. Trial Batch Sampling. Obtain a representative sample of the trial batch and split it into three equal portions \nin accordance with Tex-222-F\n. Label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” Deliver \nsamples to the appropriate laboratory as directed. \n4.4.3.1.12. Trial Batch Testing. Test the trial batch to ensure the mixture produced using the proposed JMF1 meets the \nmixture requirements shown in Table 8. Ensure the trial batch mixture is also in compliance with Table 6 and \nTable 7. Use a Department-approved laboratory listed on the MPL to perform the Hamburg wheel test on the \ntrial batch mixture, or request that the Department perform the Hamburg wheel test. Provide approximately \n25 lb. of the trial batch mixture if opting to have the Department perform the Hamburg wheel test, if \napplicable, and request that the Department perform the test. Upon receiving the sample from the \nContractor, the Engineer will be allowed 10 working days to provide the Contractor with Hamburg wheel test \nresults on the trial batch. Provide the Engineer with a copy of the trial batch test results. \n4.4.3.1.13. Development of JMF2. After the Engineer grants full approval of JMF1, evaluate the trial batch test results, \ndetermine the target mixture proportions, and submit as JMF2. The mixture produced using JMF2 must meet \nthe requirements shown in Table 6 and Table 7. Verify that JMF2 meets the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 8. \n4.4.3.1.14. Mixture Production. Use JMF2 to produce Lot 1 after receiving approval for JMF2 and, if applicable, a \npassing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch from a laboratory listed on the MPL. Once JMF2 is \napproved, and without receiving the results from the Department’s Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch, the \nContractor may proceed to Lot 1 production at their own risk. \n4.4.3.1.15. Development of JMF3. Evaluate the test results from Lot 1, determine the optimum mixture proportions, and \nsubmit as JMF3 for use in Lot 2. \n4.4.3.1.16. JMF Adjustments. If JMF adjustments are necessary to achieve the specified requirements, make the \nadjustments before beginning a new lot. The adjusted JMF must: \n be provided to the Engineer in writing before the start of a new lot, \n be numbered in sequence to the previous JMF, \n meet the master gradation limits shown in Table 6, \n meet the binder content limits shown in Table 7, and \n be within the operational tolerances of JMF2 listed shown in Table 8. \n4.4.3.1.17. Requesting Referee Testing.

JMF1 is the approved laboratory mixture design used for producing the trial batch. JMF2 is the approved mixture \ndesign developed from the trial batch used to produce Lot 1. \n2. Current JMF is JMF3 or higher. JMF3 is the approved mixture design used to produce Lot 2. \n3. Contractor may request referee testing when values exceed these tolerances. \n4. Aggregate gradation is not allowed to be outside the limits shown in Table 6. \n5. Ensure the binder content determination excludes fibers. \n6. May be obtained from asphalt mass flow meter readouts as determined by the Engineer. \n7. Binder content is not allowed to be outside the limits shown in Table 7. \n \n4.4.4. Engineer’s Responsibilities. \n4.4.4.1. Superpave Gyratory Compactor  The Engineer will use a Department SGC, calibrated in accordance with \nTex-241-F\n, to mold samples for laboratory mixture design verification. For molding trial batch and production \nspecimens, the Engineer will use the Contractor-provided SGC at the field laboratory or provide and use a \nDepartment SGC at an alternate location. \n4.4.4.1.1. Conditional Approval of JMF1 and Authorizing Trial Batch. The Engineer will review and verify \nconformance with the following information within 2 working days of receipt: \n the Contractor’s mix design report (JMF1); \n the Contractor-provided Hamburg wheel test results, if applicable; \n all required materials including aggregates, asphalt, and additives; and \n the mixture specifications. \nThe Engineer will grant the Contractor conditional approval of JMF1 if the information provided on the paper \ncopy of JMF1 indicates that the Contractor’s mixture design meets the specifications. When the Contractor \ndoes not provide Hamburg wheel test results with laboratory mixture design, 10 working days are allowed for \nconditional approval of JMF1. The Engineer will base full approval of JMF1 on the test results on mixture \nfrom the trial batch. \nUnless waived, the Engineer will determine the Micro-Deval abrasion loss in accordance with \nSection 348.2.1.1.2., “Micro-Deval Abrasion.” If the Engineer’s test results are pending after 2 working days, \nconditional approval of JMF1 will still be granted within 2 working days of receiving JMF1. When the \nEngineer’s test results become available, they will be used for specification compliance. \nThe Contractor is authorized to produce a trial batch after the Engineer grants conditional approval of JMF1. \n4.4.4.2. Hamburg Wheel Testing of JMF1.  If the Contractor requests the option to have the Department perform the \nHamburg wheel test on the laboratory mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in accordance with Tex-242-F\n \nto verify compliance with the Hamburg wheel test requirement shown in Table 7. Upon receiving the sample \nfrom the Contractor, the Engineer will be allowed 10 working days to provide the Contractor with Hamburg \nwheel test results on the laboratory mixture design. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n418 \n4.4.4.3. Ignition Oven Correction Factors. The Engineer will determine ignition oven correction factors by one of \nthe following options. \n Witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples by the Contractor in accordance with \nTex-236-F\n, Part III. The Engineer will use the identically prepared samples provided by the Contractor to \ndetermine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in accordance with \nTex-236-F, Part II. \n If the Engineer does not witness the mixing of ignition oven correction factor samples, the Engineer will \nprepare the samples to determine the aggregate and asphalt correction factors for the ignition oven in \naccordance with Tex-236-F, Part II. Notify the Contractor before performing Tex-236-F\n, Part II. Allow the \nContractor to witness the Engineer performing Tex-236-F, Part II. \nCorrection factors must be performed every 12 mo. to be used for QA testing during production. \n4.4.4.4. Testing the Trial Batch.  Within 1 ful   l working day, the Engineer will sample and test the trial batch to ensure \nthat the mixture meets the requirements shown in Table 8. If the Contractor requests the option to have the \nDepartment perform the Hamburg wheel test on the trial batch mixture, the Engineer will mold samples in \naccordance with Tex-242-F\n to verify compliance with the Hamburg wheel test requirement shown in Table 7. \nThe Engineer will have the option to perform Tex-530-C on the trial batch when shown on the plans. These \nresults may be retained and used for comparison purposes during production. \n4.4.4.5. Full Approval of JMF1. The Engineer will grant full approval of JMF1 and authorize the Contractor to \nproceed with developing JMF2 if the Engineer’s results for the trial batch meet the requirements shown in \nTables 6, 7, and 8. The Engineer will notify the Contractor that an additional trial batch is required if the trial \nbatch does not meet these requirements. \n4.4.4.6. Approval of JMF2.  The Engineer will approve JMF2 within 1 working day if the mixture meets the \nrequirements shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. \n4.4.4.7. Approval of Lot 1 Production. The Engineer will authorize the Contractor to proceed with JMF2 for Lot 1 \nproduction after a passing Hamburg wheel test result on the trial batch is achieved from a laboratory listed on \nthe MPL. The Contractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the \nHamburg wheel test on the trial batch. \n4.4.4.8. Approval of JMF3 and Subsequent JMF Changes. JMF3 and subsequent JMF changes are approved if \nthey meet the master gradation limits shown in Table 6, the asphalt binder content shown in Table 7,  and \nthey are within the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 8. The addition of a warm-mix asphalt \n(WMA)  additive to facilitate mixing or as a compaction aid does not require a new laboratory mixture design \nor trial batch. Current JMF changes that exceed the operational tolerances of JMF2 shown in Table 8 may \nrequire a new laboratory mixture design, trial batch, or both. \n4.4.4.9. Binder Content Adjustments. For JMF2 and above, the Engineer may require the Contractor to adjust the \ntarget binder content by no more than 0.3% from the current JMF. \n4.5. Production Operations.  Perform a    new trial batch when the plant or plant location is changed. All source \nchanges for asphalt will require a passing Hamburg wheel test result from a laboratory listed on the MPL.  The \nContractor may proceed at their own risk with Lot 1 production without the results from the Hamburg wheel \ntest on the trial batch. All aggregate source changes will require a new laboratory mixture design and trial \nbatch. Take corrective action and receive approval to\n proceed after any production suspension for \nnoncompliance with the specification. \n4.5.1. Storage and Heating of Materials. Do not heat the asphalt binder above the temperatures specified in \nItem 300, “Asphalts, Oils, and Emulsions,” or outside the manufacturer’s recommended values. Provide the\n \nEngineer with daily records of asphalt binder and HMA discharge temperatures (in legible and discernible \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n419 \nincrements) in accordance with Item 320, unless\n otherwise directed. Do not store mixture for a    period long \nenough to affect the quality of the mixture, nor in\n any case longer than 12 hr. unless otherwise approved. \n4.5.2. Mixing and Discharge of Materials. Notify the Engineer of the target discharge temperature and produce\n \nthe mixture within 25°F of the target. Monitor the temperature of the material in the truck before shipping to \nensure that it does not exceed the maximum production temperatures shown in Table 9. The Department will \nnot pay for or allow placement of any mixture produced above the maximum production temperatures shown in \nTable 9. \nTable 9 \nMax Production Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMax Production Temperature \n(°F) \nPG 76 345 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the \nhigh-temperature grade of the virgin asphalt binder used to \nproduce the mixture. \nControl the mixing time and temperature so that substantially all    moisture is   removed from the mixture before \ndischarging from the plant. Determine the moisture content, if requested, by oven-drying in accordance with \nTex-212-F,  Part II,    and verify that the mixture contains no more than 0.2% of moisture by weight. Obtain the \nsample immediately after discharging the mixture into the truck and perform the test promptly. \n4.6. Hauling Operations. Clean all truck beds before use to ensure that mixture is   not contaminated. Use a \nrelease agent listed on the MPL to coat the inside bed of the truck when necessary. Do not use diesel or any \nrelease agent not listed on the MPL. \nUse equipment for hauling as defined in Section 348.4.7.3.5.,   “Hauling Equipment.” Use other hauling\n \nequipment only when allowed. \n4.7. Placement Operations.  Collect haul tickets from each load of mixture delivered to the project and provide the \nDepartment’s copy to the Engineer approximately every hour, or as directed. Use a    handheld thermal\n camera \nor infrared thermometer, when a thermal imaging system is   not used, to measure and record the\n internal \ntemperature of the mixture immediately before the mix enters the material transfer device (MTD) or paver. \nMeasure the mixture temperature at a minimum frequency of one per ten trucks, or as approved. Include an \napproximate station number or Global Positioning System coordinates of the location where the temperature \nwas taken on each ticket. Ensure the mixture meets the temperature requirement shown in Table 9. Calculate\n \nthe daily yield and cumulative yield for the specified lift    and provide to the Engineer at the end of paving \noperations for each day unless otherwise directed. The Engineer may suspend production if the Contractor \nfails to produce and provide haul tickets and yield calculations by the end of paving operations for each day. \nPrepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material such as moisture, dirt,\n \nsand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. Remove vegetation from \npavement edges.  Do not allow any loose mixture onto the prepared surface before application of the membrane. \nPlace the mixture to meet the typical section requirements and produce a smooth, finished\n surface with a \nuniform appearance and texture. Offset longitudinal joints of successive courses of hot mix by\n at least 6 in. \nPlace mixture so that longitudinal joints on the surface course coincide within 6 in. of lane lines, are not \nplaced in the wheel path, or will not be covered with pavement markings, or as\n directed. Ensure that all   finished \nsurfaces will drain properly. \n4.7.1. W\neather Conditions. \n4.7.1.1. When Using a    Thermal Imaging System.  Place mixture when the roadway surface is dry and the\n roadway \nsurface temperature is   at or above 60°F,  unless otherwise approved or as shown on the plans.  Place mixtures \nonly when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway surface are suitable as determined by the \nEngineer. Provide output data from the thermal imaging system to demonstrate to the Engineer that no \nrecurring severe thermal segregation exists\n in accordance with Section 348.4.7.3.3.,   “Thermal Imaging \nSystem.” \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n420 \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to facilitate \ncompaction when the\n air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.1.2. When Not Using a Thermal Imaging System. When using a thermal camera instead of the thermal imaging \nsystem, place mixture when the roadway surface temperature is at or\n above 70°F, unless otherwise approved \nor as shown on the plans. Measure the roadway surface temperature\n using a handheld thermal camera or \ninfrared thermometer. Place mixtures\n only when weather conditions and moisture conditions of the roadway \nsurface are suitable as determined by the Engineer. The Engineer may restrict the Contractor from paving if \nthe air temperature is 60°F and falling. \nProduce mixture with a target discharge temperature higher than 300°F and with a compaction aid to facilitate \ncompaction when the\n air temperature is 70°F and falling. \n4.7.2. Application of Membrane. Apply the membrane at the rates shown in    Table 10 unless otherwise directed.\n \nSpray the membrane using a metered mechanical pressure spray bar at a temperature of 140–180°F. \nMonitor the membrane application rate and adjust the rate when directed. Verify that the spray bar can apply \nthe membrane at a uniform rate across the entire\n paving width. Apply adequate overlap of the tack coat in \nthe longitudinal direction during placement of the mat to ensure bond of adjacent mats, unless otherwise \ndirected. Unless otherwise directed, avoid tacking the vertical faces of adjacent PFC mats in the longitudinal \ndirection to avoid restricting lateral drainage. Apply tack coat to all transverse joints. Do not let    the wheels or \nother parts of the paving machine contact the freshly\n applied membrane. Do not dilute the membrane at the \nterminal, in the field, or at any other location before use. Do not allow any loose mixture onto the prepared \nsurface before application of the membrane. \n \nTable 10 \nMembrane Application Rate Limits \nMix Type \nLift Thickness \n(in.) \nMembrane Rate \n(gal. per square yard) \n \nPFC \n1-1/2 0.30–0.33 \n1-1/4 0.27–0.30 \n1 0.25–0.28 \n \n \n3/4 0.22–0.25 \nThin bonded friction course \n3/4 0.17–0.27 \n5/8 0.16–0.24 \n1/2 0.14–0.20 \n4.7.2.1. Non-Uniform Application of Membrane. Stop application if it is not uniform due to streaking, ridging, \npooling, or flowing off the roadway surface. Verify equipment condition including plugged nozzles on the \nspray bar, operating procedures, application temperature, and material properties. Determine and correct the \ncause of non-uniform application. \n4.7.2.2. Test Strips. The Engineer may perform independent tests to confirm Contractor compliance and may require \ntesting differences or failing results to be resolved before resuming production. \nThe Engineer may cease operations and require construction of test strips at the Contractor’s expense if any \nof the following occurs. \n Non-uniformity of application continues after corrective action. \n In three consecutive shots, application rate differs by more than 0.03 gal. per square yard from the rate \ndirected. \n Any shot differs by more than 0.05 gal. per square yard from the rate directed. \nThe Engineer will approve the test strip location. The Engineer may require additional test strips until the \nmembrane application meets specification requirements. \n4.7.3. Lay-Down Operations. Use the placement temperature in accordance with Table 11 to establish the \nminimum placement temperature of the mixture delivered to the paving operation. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n421 \n \nTable 11 \nMin Mixture Placement Temperature \nHigh-Temperature \nBinder Grade\n1\n \nMin Placement Temperature\n2,3 \n(°F) \nPG 76 280 \n1. The high-temperature binder grade refers to the high-temperature \ngrade of the virgin asphalt binder used to produce the mixture.  \n2. The mixture temperature must be measured using a handheld \nthermal camera or infrared thermometer immediately before \nentering MTD or paver. \n3. Min placement temperatures may be reduced 20°F if using a \nchemical WMA additive as a compaction aid, MTD with remixing \ncapabilities, or paver hopper insert with remixing capabilities. \n4.7.3.1. Thermal Profile.  Use a    handheld thermal camera or a thermal imaging system to obtain a continuous thermal \nprofile in accordance with Tex-244-F\n.  Thermal profiles are not applicable in areas described in \nSection 3 48.4.9.2.6.2., “Miscellaneous Areas.” \n4.7.3.2. Thermal Segregation. \n4.7.3.2.1. Moderate.  Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 25°F, but not exceeding 50°F. \n4.7.3.2.2. Severe.  Any areas that have a temperature differential greater than 50°F. \n4.7.3.3. Thermal Imaging System.  Review the output results when a thermal imaging system is used, and provide \nthe automated report described in Tex-244-F\n to the Engineer daily, unless otherwise directed. Modify the \npaving process as necessary to eliminate any recurring (moderate or severe) thermal segregation identified \nby the thermal imaging system. \nThe Engineer may suspend paving operations if the Contractor cannot successfully modify the paving \nprocess to eliminate recurring severe thermal segregation. Density profiles are not required and not \napplicable when using a thermal imaging system. \nProvide the Engineer with electronic copies of all daily data files that can be used with the thermal imaging \nsystem software to generate temperature profile plots daily or as requested. \n4.7.3.4. Thermal Camera. Provide the Engineer with the thermal profile of every sublot within 1 working day of the \ncompletion of each lot. When requested by the Engineer, provide the electronic files generated using the \nthermal camera. Report the results of each thermal profile in accordance with Section 348.4.2., “Reporting \nand Responsibilities.” The Engineer will use a handheld thermal camera to obtain a thermal profile at least \nonce per project. \nTake immediate corrective action to eliminate recurring moderate thermal segregation when a handheld \nthermal camera is used. \nSuspend operations and take immediate corrective action to eliminate severe thermal segregation unless \notherwise directed. Resume operations when the Engineer determines that subsequent production will meet \nthe requirements of this Section. \n4.7.3.5. Hauling Equipment.  Use live-bottom or end dump trucks to haul and transfer mixture. Except for paving \nmiscellaneous areas, end dump trucks are allowed only when used in conjunction with an MTD with remixing \ncapability,  unless otherwise approved. \n4.7.3.6. Screed Heaters. Turn off screed heaters to prevent overheating of the mat if the paver stops for more than 5 \nmin. The Engineer may evaluate the suspect area in accordance with Section 348.4.9.2.  7.,  “Recovered \nAsphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR),” if the screed heater remains on for more than 5 min. while the \npaver is    stopped. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n422 \n4.8. Compaction. Roll the freshly placed mixture using as many steel-wheeled rollers as necessary, operated in \nstatic mode, to seat the\n mixture without excessive breakage of the aggregate and to provide a smooth surface \nand uniform texture. Do not use pneumatic rollers. Use the control strip method  shown in Tex-207-F\n,  Part IV, \nto establish the rolling pattern. Thoroughly moisten the roller drums with a    soap-and-water solution to prevent \nadhesion. Use only water or an approved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other compaction equipment \nunless otherwise directed. \nFor PFC mixtures, use Tex-246-F to test and verify that the compacted mixture meets the water flow \nrequirements.  Measure the water flow once per sublot at locations directed by the Engineer. The water flow rate \nmust be less than 20 sec. Investigate the cause of the water flow rate test failures and take corrective actions \nduring production and placement to ensure the water flow rate is less than 20 sec. Suspend production if two \nconsecutive water flow rate tests fail,  unless otherwise approved. Resume production after the Engineer \napproves changes to production or placement methods. \nComplete all compaction operations before the pavement temperature drops below 180°F, unless otherwise \nallowed. The Engineer may allow compaction with a light finish roller operated in static mode for pavement \ntemperatures below 180°F. \nAllow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic, unless otherwise directed. \nSprinkle the finished mat with water or limewater, when directed, to expedite opening the roadway to traffic. \n4.9. Acceptance Plan.  Sample and test the hot mix on a lot    and sublot basis. \n4.9.1. Referee Testing.  The Materials and Tests Division is the referee laboratory. The Contractor may request \nreferee\n testing if a “remove and replace” condition is determined based on the Engineer’s test results, or if the \ndifferences between Contractor and Engineer test results exceed the maximum allowable difference in \naccordance with Table 8 and the differences cannot be resolved. The Contractor may also request referee \ntesting if\n the Engineer’s test results require suspension of production and the Contractor’s test results are \nwithin specification limits. Make the request within 5    working days after receiving test results from the\n \nEngineer. Referee tests will be performed only on the sublot in question and only for the tests in question. \nAllow 10 working days from the time the referee laboratory receives the samples for test results to\n be \nreported. The Department may require the Contractor to reimburse the Department for referee tests if\n more \nthan three referee tests per project are required and the Engineer’s test results are closer to the referee\n test \nresults than the Contractor’s test results. \n4.9.2. Production Acceptance. \n4.9.2.1. Production Lot.  A production lot consists of four equal sublots. The default quantity for Lot 1 is 1,000 ton; \nhowever, when requested by the Contractor, the Engineer may increase the quantity for Lot 1 to no more \nthan 2,000 ton. The Engineer will select subsequent lot sizes based on the anticipated daily production such \nthat approximately three–four sublots are produced each day. The lot size will be between 1,000 ton and \n4,000 ton. The Engineer may change the lot size before the Contractor begins any lot. \n4.9.2.1.1. Incomplete Production Lots.  If a lot is begun but cannot be completed, such as on the last day of \nproduction or in other circumstances deemed appropriate, the Engineer may close the lot. Close all lots \nwithin 5 working days unless otherwise allowed. \n4.9.2.2. P\nroduction Sampling. \n4.9.2.2.1. Mixture Sampling.  The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots from trucks at \nthe plant in accordance with Tex-222-F\n. The sampler will split each sample into three equal portions in \naccordance with Tex-200-F and label these portions as “Contractor,” “Engineer,” and “Referee.” The \nEngineer will perform or witness the sample splitting and take immediate possession of the samples labeled \n“Engineer” and “Referee.” The Engineer will maintain custody of the samples labeled “Engineer” and \n“Referee” until the Department’s testing is completed. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n423 \n4.9.2.2.1.1. Random Sample.  At the beginning of the project, the Engineer will select random numbers for all production \nsublots. Determine sample locations in accordance with Tex-225-F\n. Take one sample for each sublot at the \nrandomly selected location. The Engineer will perform or witness the sampling of production sublots. \n4.9.2.2.1.2. Blind Sample.  For one sublot per lot, the Engineer will sample, split,  and test a “blind” production sample \ninstead of the random sample collected by the Contractor. The location of the Engineer’s “blind” sample will \nnot be disclosed to the Contractor before sampling. The Engineer’s “blind” sample may be randomly selected \nin accordance with Tex-225-F\n for any sublot or selected at the discretion of the Engineer. The Engineer may \nsample and test an additional blind sample when the random sampling process does not result in obtaining a \nsample. \nFor one sublot per lot, the Contractor must obtain from the Engineer a “blind” production sample collected by \nthe Engineer. If desired, the Contractor may witness the collection of blind samples. Test either the “blind” or \nthe random sample; however, referee\n testing for the sublot (if applicable) will be based on a comparison of \nresults from the “blind” sample. \n4.9.2.2.2. Informational Hamburg Wheel and Overlay Testing. Select one random sublot from Lot 2 or higher for \nHamburg wheel and overlay testing during the first week of production. Obtain and provide the Engineer with \napproximately 90 lb. of mixture, sampled in accordance with Tex-222-F\n, in sealed containers, boxes, or bags \nlabeled with the control-section-job (CSJ) number, mixture type, lot number, and sublot number. The \nEngineer will ship the mixture to the Materials and Tests Division for Hamburg wheel and overlay testing. \nResults from these tests will not be used for specification compliance. \n4.9.2.2.3. Asphalt Binder Sampling.  The Engineer will witness the Contractor obtain a 1-qt. sample of the asphalt \nbinder for each lot    of\n mixture produced.

Membrane Sampling.  The Engineer will obtain a 1-qt. sample of the polymer-modified emulsion for each lot \nof mixture produced in accordance with Tex-500-C\n,  Part III. The Engineer will notify the Contractor when the \nsampling will occur and will witness the collection of the sample. Obtain the sample at approximately the \nsame time the mixture random sample is obtained. Label the can with the corresponding lot    and sublot \nnumbers,  producer name; producer facility,  grade, District,  date sampled, and project information, including \nhighway and CSJ number. The Engineer will retain these samples for 2 mo. \nAt least once per project, the Engineer will collect split samples of the polymer-modified emulsion. The \nEngineer will submit one split sample to the Materials and Tests Division to verify compliance with Item 300, \nand will retain the other split sample for 2 mo. The Engineer may test as often as necessary to ensure the \nresidual of the emulsion is greater than or equal to the specification requirement in Item 300. \n4.9.2.3. Production Testing. The Contractor and Engineer must perform production tests shown in Table 12. The \nContractor has the option to verify the Engineer’s test results on split samples provided by the Engineer. \nDetermine compliance with operational tolerances shown in Table 8   for all sublots. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n424 \nAnytime during production, the Engineer may require the Contractor to verify the following based on\n \nquantities used: \n lime content (within ±0.1% of JMF), when PG binder is specified; and \n fiber content (within ±0.03% of JMF), when PG binder is specified. \nThe Engineer may allow\n alternate methods for determining the asphalt binder content and aggregate \ngradation if the aggregate mineralogy is such that Tex-236-F\n, Part I does not yield reliable results. Provide evidence \nthat results from Tex-236-F,  Part I    are not reliable before requesting permission to use an alternate method \nunless otherwise allowed.

Individual Loads of Hot Mix.  The Engineer may reject individual truckloads of hot mix. When a    load of hot \nmix is   rejected for reasons other than temperature, contamination, or excessive uncoated particles, the\n \nContractor may request that the rejected load be tested. Make this request within 4    hr. of rejection. The \nEngineer will sample and test the mixture. If test results are within the operational tolerances shown in \nTable 8, payment will be made for the load. If test results are not within operational tolerances, no payment \nwill be made for the load. \n\n2024 Specifications  348 \n425 \n4.9.2.6. Placement Acceptance. \n4.9.2.6.1. Placement Lot.  A   placement lot    consists of four placement sublots. A placement sublot consists of the area\n \nplaced during a production sublot. \n4.9.2.6.2. Miscellaneous Areas. Miscellaneous areas include areas that typically involve significant handwork or \ndiscontinuous paving operations,  such as mailbox turnouts, crossovers, gores, pavement repair sections less \nthan 300 ft., and other similar areas. The specified layer thickness is based on the rate of 90 lb. per square \nyard for each inch of pavement unless another rate is shown on the plans. Miscellaneous areas are not \nsubject to thermal profiles or water flow testing. \n4.9.2.7. Recovered Asphalt Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR).  The Engineer may take production samples or\n \ncores from suspect areas of the project to determine recovered asphalt properties. Asphalt binders with an \naging ratio greater than 3.5 do not meet the requirements for recovered asphalt properties and may be \ndeemed defective when tested and evaluated by the Materials and Tests Division. The aging ratio is the DSR \nvalue\n of the extracted binder divided by the DSR value of the original unaged binder. Obtain DSR values in \naccordance with AASHTO T 315 at the specified high-temperature PG of the asphalt. The Engineer may \nrequire removal and replacement of the defective material at the Contractor’s expense. The\n asphalt binder will \nbe recovered for testing from production samples or cores in accordance with Tex-211-F\n. \n4.9.2.8. Irregularities.  Identify and correct irregularities,  including segregation, rutting, raveling, flushing, fat spots, mat \nslippage, irregular color, irregular texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, uncoated aggregate particles, \nor broken aggregate particles. The Engineer may also identify irregularities, and in such cases, the Engineer \nwill promptly notify the Contractor. If   the Engineer determines that the irregularity will adversely affect \npavement performance, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace (at the Contractor’s \nexpense) areas of the pavement that contain irregularities. The Engineer may also require the Contractor to \nremove and replace (at the Contractor’s expense) areas where the mixture does not bond to the existing \npavement. \nIf   irregularities are detected, the Engineer may require the Contractor to\n immediately suspend operations or \nmay allow the Contractor to continue operations for no more than 1 day  while the Contractor is   taking \nappropriate corrective action. \n4.9.2.9.

Cease placement 24 hr. before the weather forecast (National \nWeather Service) predicts temperatures below 32°F unless otherwise approved. \n4.6. Surface Preparation. Prepare the surface by removing raised pavement markers and objectionable material \nsuch as moisture, dirt, sand, leaves, and other loose impediments from the surface before placing mixture. \nProvide a water spray immediately ahead of the spreader box when required for existing surface conditions \nwhen tack coat is not required. Apply water at a rate that will dampen the entire surface without any \nfree-flowing water ahead of the spreader box. \n4.7. Tack Coat. Apply tack coat uniformly at the rate directed by the Engineer when shown on the plans. The \nEngineer will set the rate between 0.04 and 0.10 gal. of residual asphalt per square yard of surface area. \nApply the tack coat in a uniform manner to avoid streaks and other irregular patterns. \n4.8. Material Transfer. Minimize construction joints by providing continuous loading of material during \nplacement. Remove oversized material before transferring the aggregates to the mixing machine. \n4.9. Placing. Make necessary adjustments so that the mixture will have sufficient working life to allow for proper \nplacement, with considerations for aggregate moisture and at the predicted ambient temperature and \nhumidity. Spread the mixture uniformly to the lines and grades shown on the plans or as directed using a \nmechanical type spreader box. Shift the spreader box when necessary to maintain proper alignment. Clean \nthe spreader box regularly to prevent buildup from occurring and to minimize clumps. Set and maintain the \nspreader box skids to prevent chatter in the finished mat. Prevent loss of material from the spreader box by \n\n2024 Specifications  350 \n431 \nmaintaining contact between the front seal and the road surface. Adjust the rear seal to provide the desired \nspread. Adjust the secondary strike-off to provide the desired surface texture. Clean strike-off regularly to \nprevent buildup from occurring. \n4.10. Curing. Protect the finished mat from traffic until the mixture cures and will not be damaged by traffic. Adjust \nmixture properties according to humidity conditions and ambient temperatures to allow traffic on completed \ntravel lanes within 1 hr. after placement with no damage to the surface. Protect locations subject to sharp \nturning, stopping, and starting traffic for longer periods when necessary. \n4.11. Production Testing. Control the production process within the operational tolerances shown in Table 5 and \nTable 6. Provide access to the mixing unit discharge stream for sampling purposes. Suspend production \nwhen the Engineer’s test results exceed the operational tolerances.

Design a mixture to meet the requirements shown in Table 1 using a Superpave Gyratory \nCompactor. Compact specimens at the anticipated production temperature between 200°F and 250°F at \n50 gyrations in accordance with Tex-241-F\n. The target number of gyrations may be adjusted when approved. \nSubmit the completed mix design for approval before the start of the project. Perform additional mix designs \nbased on road variability, as directed. \n4.2.1. Sampling. Before bidding, the Engineer will provide material and pavement information obtained from \nroadway cores, such as layer thicknesses, gradation, asphalt content and recovered asphalt penetration of \nthe pavement to be recycled using the Materials and Tests Division’s protocol and guidelines. Additional \ncores may be taken by potential Bidders to obtain further information on the material to be recycled when \napproved. After the project is awarded, obtain an adequate amount of roadway cores throughout the project \nto perform the mixture design and to determine the existing condition of the roadway to account for any \nvariability within the project limits. Evaluate the material from the roadway cores and document any existing \nmaterial that could be detrimental to the process (e.g., rubber seal and fabric underseal). At  least 2 in. of the \nexisting pavement structure must remain in place following milling. Document any base or uncoated material \n\n2024 Specifications  358 \n444 \nwithin the layer to be recycled. Provide documentation of any of these conditions before proceeding with the \nmixture design. \n4.2.2. Job-Mix Formula Approval. The job-mix formula (JMF) is the combined aggregate gradation and target \nasphalt recycling agent percentage established from the laboratory mixture design. \n4.2.3. Hot-Mix Asphalt. If the process requires new HMA, use materials in accordance with Section 341.4.4., \n“Mixture Design,” or as shown on the plans. Document in the JMF the percentage of new HMA used in the \nlaboratory mix design submitted. \n4.2.4. Aggregates.

Heat the existing pavement without charring the pavement surface and without \nproducing undesirable pollutants. Maintain a minimum temperature of 200°F of the material immediately \nbehind the heater. Uniformly heat the pavement surface across its full lane width such that cold milling of the \npavement surface does not occur. \n4.4. Pavement Milling. Mill the existing pavement to the required depth and width as shown on the plans. Do not \ndisturb the underlying material in the existing roadway when recycling. Remove grass and other vegetation \nfrom the edge of the existing pavement to prevent contamination of the recycled bituminous material during \nthis operation. \nUse the milling heads to remove at least 3 in.    laterally of the completed adjacent pass and make a square \nvertical cut in the heated material to achieve a hot-bonded longitudinal joint. Ensure all material across the \nfull lane width is processed between consecutive lane passes to assure any wedges (slivers) of unprocessed \nmaterials are not left untouched by the milling heads and covered by the recycled material, unless otherwise \napproved. \nEnsure the temperature of the milled surface directly behind the milling heads is greater than 160°F so cold \nmilling does not occur. Clean all loosened asphalt material away using the milling heads. A milling tooth \npattern must be clearly visible after milling. \nRemove all material around manholes and utility structures before paving the recycled mixture to allow for \nthe plan depth of the pavement around these structures. \n\n2024 Specifications  358 \n445 \nCold mill and sweep clean any areas that cannot be heated and milled by the recycling equipment. Properly \ntack and pave these areas of cold milling before the recycling process. \n4.5. Addition of Recycling Agent. Incorporate the asphalt recycling agent into the hot recycled bituminous \nmaterial at the rate determined by the approved mix designs. Sampling and testing during mixture production \nmay result in varying quantities of recycling agent at different portions of the project to meet the requirements \nshown in Table 1. Change the recycling agent content only as approved. \n4.6. Placement of Recycled Material. Spread the material using a paver and screed attached to the mixing and \nmilling unit or a traditional paver in a separate and continuous operation meeting the requirements of \nSection 320.2.3.1., “Asphalt Paver.” Spread the recycled material to the established lines and grades. Ensure \nthe temperature of the recycled material behind paver is greater than 200°F. \n4.7. Compaction. Uniformly compact the pavement to contain between 3.8% and 8.5% in-place air voids. \nFurnish the type, size, and number of rollers required for compaction as approved and meeting the \nrequirements of Article 210.2., “Equipment.” Use a pneumatic-tire roller to seal the surface unless excessive \npickup of fines occurs. Use additional rollers as required to remove any roller marks. Use only water or an \napproved release agent on rollers, tamps, and other compaction equipment unless otherwise directed. \nOn the first day of production, use the control strip method in accordance with Tex-207-F\n, Part IV, to \nestablish the rolling pattern that will produce the desired in-place air voids unless otherwise directed. \nOperate rollers in vibratory mode only when doing so does not damage the pavement. Establish a new rolling \npattern when changes occur in the recycled mix or placement conditions. Adjust or cease compaction when \ncracking or displacement occurs. Ensure that pavement is fully compacted before allowing rollers to park on \nthe pavement. \n4.8. Traffic. Allow the compacted pavement to cool to 160°F or lower before opening to traffic unless otherwise \ndirected. Maintain the surface of the recycled pavement in a condition suitable for the safe movement of \ntraffic. Power broom the pavement surface to remove all loose particles as directed. \n4.9. Irregularities. Identify and correct irregularities, including, but not limited to, segregation, rutting, raveling, \nflushing, fat spots, mat slippage, irregular color, irregular texture, roller marks, tears, gouges, streaks, \nuncoated aggregate particles, or broken aggregate particles. The Engineer may also identify irregularities, \nand in such cases will promptly notify the Contractor. If the Engineer determines that the irregularity will \nadversely affect pavement performance, the Engineer may require the Contractor to remove and replace (at \nthe Contractor’s expense) areas of the pavement that contain irregularities and areas where the mixture does \nnot bond to the existing pavement. If irregularities are detected, the Engineer may require the Contractor to \nimmediately suspend operations or may allow the Contractor to continue operations for no more than 1 day \nwhile the Contractor takes appropriate corrective action. \n4.10. Curing. A surface treatment may be allowed as the final riding surface when shown on the plans. Cure the \nhot in-place recycled bituminous material for at least 7 days, or as directed when HMA or another applicable \nsurface treatment is placed as a surface course. \n4.11. Weather Conditions. Unless otherwise approved, perform hot in-place recycling operations when the \nexisting pavement surface temperature is 60°F or higher and when weather conditions and moisture \nconditions of the roadway surface are suitable, in the opinion of the Engineer. Measure the roadway surface \ntemperature using a handheld infrared thermometer. The Engineer may allow mixture placement to begin \nbefore the roadway surface reaching the required temperature requirements, if conditions are such that the \nroadway surface will reach the required temperature within 2 hr. of beginning placement operations. \n\n2024 Specifications  358 \n446 \n5. PRODUCTION ACCEPTANCE \n5.1. Production Lot. Each day of production is defined as a production lot. Lots will be sequentially numbered \nand will correspond to each new day of production.

Provide the equipment and means to obtain and trim roadway cores onsite. Onsite is \ndefined as in close proximity to where the cores are taken. Obtain the cores within 1 working day of the time \nthe placement lot is completed unless otherwise approved. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, obtain two \n6-  in. diameter cores side-by-side at each location selected by the Engineer for in-place air void \ndetermination. Mark the cores for identification, measure and record the untrimmed core height, and provide \nthe information to the Engineer. The Engineer will witness the coring operation and measurement of the core \nthickness. Visually inspect each core and verify that the current paving layer is bonded to the underlying \nlayer. If an adequate bond does not exist between the current and underlying layer, take corrective action to \nensure that an adequate bond will be achieved during subsequent placement operations. \n\n2024 Specifications  358 \n447 \nTrim the cores after obtaining the cores from the roadway in accordance with Tex-207-F\n if the core heights \nmeet the minimum untrimmed shown on the plans. Trim the cores onsite in the Engineer’s presence. Use a \npermanent marker or paint pen to record the date and lot number on each core as well as the designation as \nCore A or Core B. The Engineer may require additional information to be marked on the core and may \nchoose to sign or initial the core. The Engineer will take custody of the cores immediately after they are \ntrimmed and will retain custody of the cores until the Department’s testing is completed. Before turning the \ntrimmed cores over to the Engineer, the Contractor may elect to wrap the trimmed cores or secure them in a \nmanner that will reduce the risk of possible damage occurring during transport by the Engineer. After testing, \nthe Engineer will return the cores to the Contractor. \nThe Engineer may elect to have the cores transported back to the Department’s laboratory at the HMA plant \nvia the Contractor’s haul truck or other designated vehicle. In such cases where the cores will be out of the \nEngineer’s possession during transport, the Engineer will use Department-provided security bags and the \nRoadway Core Custody protocol located on the Department’s website to provide a secure means and \nprocess that protects the integrity of the cores during transport. \nInstead of the Contractor trimming the cores onsite immediately after coring, the Engineer and the Contractor \nmay mutually agree to have the trimming operations performed at an alternate location, such as a field \nlaboratory or other similar location. In such cases, the Engineer will take possession of the cores immediately \nafter they are obtained from the roadway and will retain custody of the cores until testing is completed. Either \nthe Department or Contractor representative may perform trimming of the cores. The Engineer will witness all \ntrimming operations in cases where the Contractor representative performs the trimming operation. \nDry the core holes and tack the sides and bottom immediately after obtaining the cores. Fill the hole with the \nsame type of mixture, and properly compact the mixture. Repair core holes by other methods when \napproved. \n6.3. Placement Testing. The Engineer may measure in-place air voids at any time during the project to verify \nspecification compliance. \n6.3.1. In-Place Air Voids. The Engineer will measure in-place air voids in accordance with Tex-207-F\n and \nTex-227-F. Before drying to a constant weight, cores may be pre-dried using a Corelok or similar vacuum \ndevice to remove excess moisture. The Engineer will use the corresponding theoretical maximum specific \ngravity to determine the air void content of each core. The Engineer will use the average air void content of \nthe two cores to determine the in-place air voids at the selected location. \nThe Engineer will use the vacuum method to seal the core if required in accordance with Tex-207-F.  The \nEngineer will use the test results from the unsealed core if the sealed core yields a higher specific gravity \nthan the unsealed core. \nWhen the in-place air voids exceed the range of 3.8–8.5%, take immediate corrective action to bring the \noperation within these tolerances. The Engineer may suspend operations or require removal and \nreplacement if the in-place air voids are less than 2.7% or greater than 9.9%. The Engineer will allow paving \nto resume when the proposed corrective action is likely to yield between 3.8% and 8.5% in-place air voids. \n6.3.2. New Hot-Mix Asphalt. If applicable, control the quantity of new HMA added to the recycled mix from haul \ntickets to within 5.0% of the target JMF. \n6.3.3. Depth of Recycled Material. Maintain the required nominal depth on both outside vertical faces and in the \ncenter of the recycled area. Manually measure and report recorded depths each 1/4 mi.  approximately each \nhour of production. Measure from the bottom of the mill pass to the top of the surface placed. \n6.4. Ride Quality. Use Surface Test Type A to evaluate ride quality in accordance with Item 585, “Ride Quality \nfor Pavement Surfaces,” unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n\n2024 Specifications  358 \n448 \n7. MEASUREMENT \nHot in-place recycling of asphalt concrete surface will be measured by the square yard. The dimensions for \ndetermining the surface areas are established by the depths and widths shown on the plans and the lengths \nmeasured at placement. \nRecycling agent will be measured at the applied temperature by the gallon from strap depths measured from \nthe calibrated strap stick for each load or other approved automated means. \nNew HMA will be measured by the ton of composite mix, which includes asphalt, aggregate, and additives. \nMeasure the new HMA on scales in accordance with Item 520, “Weighing and Measuring Equipment.” \n8. PAYMENT \nHot in-place recycling of asphalt concrete surfaces will be paid for at the unit bid price for “Hot In-Place \nRecycling of Asphalt Concrete (Surface)” of the depth specified. \nAsphalt recycling agent will be paid for separately at the unit bid price for “Hot In-Place Recycling of Asphalt \nConcrete (Recycling Agent).” \nNew HMA will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Hot In-Place Recycling of Asphalt Concrete (Mix).” \nThis price is full compensation for the removal and processing of the existing pavement; for preparing, \nhauling, and placing materials; for all freight involved; for all manipulations, including rolling and brooming; \nand for all labor, tools, equipment, and incidentals necessary to complete the work.

Install and rigidly \nsecure a complete joint assembly and bulkhead in the planned transverse contraction joint location when the \nplacing of concrete is intentionally stopped. Install a transverse construction joint either at a planned \ntransverse contraction joint location or mid-slab between planned transverse contraction joints when the \nplacing of concrete is unintentionally stopped. Install tie bars of the size and spacing used in the longitudinal \njoints for mid-slab construction joints. \nPlace dowels at mid-depth of the pavement slab, parallel to the surface. Place dowels for transverse \ncontraction joints parallel to the pavement edge. Tolerances for location and alignment of dowels will be \nshown on the plans. For dowels used in a contraction joint, coat the entire length of the dowels with a thin \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n453 \nfilm of grease, wax, silicone, or other approved de-bonding material. For dowels used in an expansion joint, \ncoat half the length with a thin film of grease, wax, silicone, or other approved de-bonding material; provide \ndowel caps on the coated half of each dowel bar.  \n4.4. Curb Joints. Construct curb joints in accordance with Item 529. \n4.5. Placing and Removing Forms. Use clean and oiled forms. Secure forms on a base or firm subgrade that is \naccurately graded and that provides stable support without deflection and movement by formriding \nequipment. Pin every form at least at the middle and near each end. Tightly join and key form sections \ntogether to prevent relative displacement. \nSet side forms far enough in advance of concrete placement to permit inspection. Check conformity of the \ngrade, alignment, and stability of forms immediately before placing concrete, and make all necessary \ncorrections. Use a straightedge or other approved method to test the top of forms to ensure that the ride \nquality requirements for the completed pavement will be met. Stop paving operations if forms settle or deflect \nmore than 1/8 in. under finishing operations. Reset forms to line and grade, and refinish the concrete surface \nto correct grade. \nAvoid damage to the edge of the pavement when removing side forms and bulkhead forms. Repair damage \nresulting from form removal with an approved repair material within 24 hr. after form removal unless \notherwise approved. Chip excessively honeycombed areas to sound concrete, and repair with an approved \nrepair material within 24 hr. after form removal unless otherwise approved. Clean joint face within 24 hr. after \na bulkhead for a transverse construction joint has been removed unless otherwise approved. Promptly apply \nmembrane curing compound to the edge of the concrete pavement when forms are removed before 72 hr. \nafter concrete placement. \nForms that are not the same depth as the pavement but within 2 in. of that depth are permitted if the subbase \nis trenched or the full width and length of the form base are supported with a firm material to produce the \nrequired pavement thickness. Promptly repair the form trench after use. Use flexible or curved wood or metal \nforms for curves of 100-ft. radius or less. \n4.6. Concrete Delivery. Clean delivery equipment as necessary to prevent accumulation of old concrete before \nloading fresh concrete. Use agitated delivery equipment for concrete designed to have a slump of more than \n5   in. Segregated concrete is subject to rejection. \nBegin the discharge of concrete delivered in agitated delivery equipment in accordance with Item 421. Place \nnon-agitated concrete within 45 min. after batching. Reduce times as directed when hot weather or other \nconditions cause quick setting of the concrete. \n4.7. Concrete Placement. Do not allow the pavement edge to deviate from the established paving line by more \nthan 1/2 in. at any point. Place the concrete as near as possible to its final location, and minimize \nsegregation and rehandling. Distribute concrete using shovels where hand spreading is necessary. Do not \nuse rakes or vibrators to distribute concrete. \n4.7.1. Consolidation. Consolidate all concrete using approved mechanical vibrators operated on the front of the \npaving equipment. Use immersion-type vibrators that simultaneously consolidate the full width of the \nplacement when machine finishing. Keep vibrators from dislodging reinforcement. Use hand-operated \nvibrators to consolidate concrete for concrete pavement (formed) placements, and along forms, at all joints, \nand in areas not accessible to the machine-mounted vibrators. Do not operate machine-mounted vibrators \nwhile the paving equipment is stationary. Vibrator operations are subject to review. \n4.7.2. Curbs. Curbs will be in accordance with Item 529. \n4.7.3. Temperature Restrictions. Place concrete that is between 40°F and 95°F when measured in accordance \nwith Tex-422-A\n at the time of discharge, except that concrete may be used if it was already in transit when \nthe temperature was found to exceed the allowable maximum. Take immediate corrective action or cease \nconcrete production when the concrete temperature exceeds 95°F. \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n454 \nDo not place concrete when the ambient temperature in the shade is below 40°F and falling, unless \napproved. Concrete may be placed when the ambient temperature in the shade is above 35°F and rising or \nabove 40°F. Protect the pavement with an approved insulating material capable of protecting the concrete \nfor the specified curing period when temperatures warrant protection against freezing. Submit for approval \nproposed measures to protect the concrete from anticipated freezing weather for the first 72 hr. after \nplacement. Repair or replace all concrete damaged by freezing. \n4.8. Spreading and Finishing. Finish all concrete pavement using approved self-propelled equipment. Use \npower-driven spreaders, power-driven vibrators, power-driven strike-off screed, or approved alternate \nequipment to strike-off the surface of the concrete to the required section and grade without surface voids. \nUse float equipment for final finishing. Use concrete with a consistency that allows completion of all finishing \noperations without addition of water to the surface. Use the minimal amount of water fog mist necessary to \nmaintain a moist surface. Reduce fogging if float or straightedge operations result in excess slurry. \n4.8.1. Finished Surface. Perform sufficient checks using a minimum 10-ft. long straightedge on the plastic \nconcrete to ensure the final surface is within the tolerances specified in Surface Test A in accordance with \nItem 585, “Ride Quality for Pavement Surfaces.” Check with the straightedge parallel to the centerline. \n4.8.2. Maintenance of Surface Moisture. Prevent surface drying of the pavement before application of the curing \nsystem by means that may include water fogging, the use of wind screens, or the use of evaporation \nretardants. Apply evaporation retardant at the manufacturer’s recommended rate. Reapply the evaporation \nretardant as needed to maintain the concrete surface in a moist condition until curing system is applied. Do \nnot use evaporation retardant as a finishing aid. Failure to take acceptable precautions to prevent surface \ndrying of the pavement will be cause for shutdown of pavement operations. \n4.8.3. Surface Texturing. Complete final texturing before the concrete has attained its initial set. Drag the carpet \nlongitudinally along the pavement surface with the carpet contact surface area adjusted to provide a \nsatisfactory coarsely textured surface. Prevent grout from plugging the carpet. Do not perform carpet \ndragging operations while there is excessive bleed water. \nA metal-tine texture finish is required unless otherwise shown on the plans. Provide longitudinal tining unless \notherwise shown on the plans. Immediately following the carpet drag, apply a single coat of evaporation \nretardant, if needed, at the rate recommended by the manufacturer. Provide the metal-tine finish immediately \nafter the concrete surface has set enough for consistent tining. Operate the metal-tine device to obtain \ngrooves approximately 3/16 in. deep, with a minimum depth of 1/8 in., and approximately 1/12 in. wide. Do \nnot overlap a previously tined area. Use manual methods to achieve similar results on ramps, small or \nirregular areas, and narrow width sections of pavements. Repair damage to the edge of the slab and joints \nimmediately after texturing. Do not tine pavement that will be overlaid or that is scheduled for blanket \ndiamond grinding or shot blasting. \nTarget a carpet drag texture of 0.04 in., as measured by Tex-436-A\n, when carpet drag is the only surface \ntexture required on the plans. Ensure adequate and consistent macro-texture is achieved by applying \nenough weight to the carpet and by keeping grout from plugging the carpet. Correct any location with a \ntexture less than 0.03 in. by diamond grinding or shot blasting. The Engineer will determine the test locations \nat points located transversely to the direction of traffic in the outside wheel path. \n4.8.4. Small, Irregular Area, or Narrow Width Placements. Use hand equipment and procedures that produce a \nconsolidated and finished pavement section to the line and grade where machine placements and finishing of \nconcrete pavement are not practical. \n4.8.5. Emergency Procedures. Use hand-operated equipment for applying texture, evaporation retardant, and \ncure in the event of equipment breakdown. \n4.9. Curing. Keep the concrete pavement surface from drying in accordance with Section 360.4.8.2., \n“Maintenance of Surface Moisture,” until the curing material has been applied. Maintain and promptly repair \ndamage to curing materials on exposed surfaces of concrete pavement continuously for at least 3 curing \ndays. A curing day is defined as a 24-hr. period when either the temperature taken in the shade away from \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n455 \nartificial heat is above 50°F for at least 19 hr. or the surface temperature of the concrete is maintained above \n40°F for 24 hr. Curing begins when the concrete curing system has been applied. Stop concrete paving if \ncuring compound is not being applied promptly and maintained adequately. Other methods of curing in \naccordance with Item 422 may be used when specified or approved. \n4.9.1. Membrane Curing. Spray the concrete surface uniformly with two coats of membrane curing compound at \nan individual application rate of no more than 180 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply the curing compound before \nallowing the concrete surface to dry. \nManage finishing and texturing operations to ensure placement of curing compound on a moist concrete \nsurface, relatively free of bleed water, to prevent any plastic shrinkage from cracking. Time the application of \ncuring compound to prevent plastic shrinkage from cracking. \nMaintain curing compounds in a uniformly agitated condition, free of settlement before and during \napplication. Do not thin or dilute the curing compound. \nApply additional compound at the same rate of coverage to correct damage where the coating shows \ndiscontinuities or other defects or if rain falls on the newly coated surface before the film has dried enough to \nresist damage. Ensure that the curing compound coats the sides of the tining grooves. \n4.9.2. Asphalt Curing. Apply a uniform coating of asphalt curing at a rate of 90 sq. ft.–180 sq. ft. per gallon when \nan asphaltic concrete overlay is required. Apply curing immediately after texturing and once the free moisture \n(sheen) has disappeared. Obtain approval to add water to the emulsion to improve spray distribution. \nMaintain the asphalt application rate when using diluted emulsions. Maintain asphalt emulsions in a mixed \ncondition during application. \n4.9.3. Curing Class HES Concrete. Provide membrane curing in accordance with Section 360.4.9.1., “Membrane \nCuring,” or wet mat curing in accordance with Section 422.4.8., “Final Curing,” for all Class HES concrete. \n4.10. Sawing Joints. Saw joints to the depth shown on the plans as soon as sawing can be accomplished without \ndamage to the pavement, regardless of time of day or weather conditions. Some minor raveling of the saw-\ncut is acceptable. Use a chalk line, string line, sawing template, or other approved method to provide a true \njoint alignment. Provide enough saws to match the paving production rate to ensure sawing completion at the \nearliest possible time to avoid uncontrolled cracking. The Engineer will evaluate the cause of the uncontrolled \ncracking and direct any necessary repairs. Reduce paving production if necessary to ensure timely sawing of \njoints. Promptly restore membrane cure damaged within the first 72 hr. of curing. \nThe Engineer will check the depth of saw cuts in accordance with Tex-423-A\n within 24 hrs. after saw-cutting \nor before joints are sealed, whichever is sooner. Frequency of checks will be as follows: \n every 500 ft. or fraction thereof for all longitudinal contraction joints, and  \n 10% of transverse contraction joints in CPCD for each daily placement. \nResaw contraction joints that are deficient in depth by more than 1/4 in. from plan depth within 24 hr. of depth \nchecks.  \n4.11. Cleaning and Sealing Joints. Clean and seal joints in accordance with Item 438, “Cleaning and Sealing \nJoints.” Repair excessive spalling of the joint saw groove using an approved method before installing the \nsealant. Seal all joints before opening the pavement to all traffic. Joint sealants are not required on concrete \npavement that is to be overlaid with asphaltic materials. \n4.12. Protection of Pavement. Erect and maintain barricades and other standard and approved devices that will \nexclude all vehicles and equipment from the newly placed pavement for the periods specified. Protect the \npavement from damage due to crossings using approved methods before opening to traffic. Where a detour \nis not readily available or economically feasible, an occasional crossing of the roadway with overweight \nequipment may be permitted for relocating equipment only, but not for hauling material. When an occasional \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n456 \ncrossing of overweight equipment is permitted, temporary matting or other approved methods may be \nrequired. \nMaintain an adequate supply of sheeting or other material to cover and protect fresh concrete surface from \nweather damage. Apply as needed to protect the pavement surface from weather. \n4.13. Opening to Traffic. Testing for opening pavement to traffic is the responsibility of the Contractor unless \notherwise shown on the plans or as directed. Before opening pavement to traffic: \n provide test results to the Engineer for review, if necessary, \n clean pavement,  \n place stable material against pavement edges,  \n seal joints, and  \n perform all other traffic-safety related work. \n4.13.1. Opening Pavement to All Traffic. Pavements can be open to all traffic: \n when the pavement is 7 days old, \n when 3-day curing is complete and the concrete has attained a compressive strength of 3,200 psi, \n after 24 hr. and the concrete has attained a compressive strength of 3,200 psi when Class HES \nconcrete is used, or \n after the concrete has been cured for at least 8 hr. and attained a minimum compressive strength of \n1,800 psi when Class HES concrete is used. \n4.13.2. Opening Pavement to Construction Equipment. Unless otherwise shown on the plans, concrete \npavement may be opened to concrete paving equipment and related delivery equipment after the concrete is \nat least 48 hr. old and has attained a compressive strength of 3,200 psi. Keep delivery equipment at least \n2   ft. from the edge of the concrete pavement. Keep tracks of the paving equipment at least 1 ft. from the \npavement edge. Protect textured surfaces from the paving equipment. Restore damaged membrane curing \nas soon as possible. Repair pavement damaged by paving or delivery equipment before opening to all traffic. \n4.13.3. Maturity Method. Maturity method, in accordance with Tex-426-A\n, may be used to estimate concrete \nstrength for opening pavement to traffic. Install at least two maturity sensors for each day’s placement in \nareas where the maturity method will be used for opening. Maturity sensors, when used, will be installed near \nthe day’s final placement for areas being evaluated.  \nThe Engineer will test specimens to verify the strength-maturity relationship in accordance with Tex-426-A. \nThe strength-maturity relationship will be verified at least every 10 days of production after the first day. \nEstablish a new strength-maturity relationship when the strength specimens deviate more than 10% from the \nmaturity-estimated strengths. Suspend use of the maturity method for opening pavements to traffic when the \nstrength-maturity relationship deviates by more than 10% until a new strength-maturity relationship is \nestablished. \nThe Engineer will determine the frequency of verification when the maturity method is used intermittently or \nfor only specific areas. \n4.13.4. Emergency Opening to Traffic. Open the pavement to traffic under emergency conditions, when the \npavement is at least 72 hr. old, when directed in writing.  \n4.14. Sampling and Testing of Concrete. Unless otherwise specified, all fresh and hardened concrete is subject \nto testing as follows. \n4.14.1. Fresh Concrete. Provide safe access and assistance to the Engineer during sampling. Fresh concrete will \nbe sampled in accordance with Tex-407-A\n. \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n457 \n4.14.2. Testing Concrete.  The Engineer will test the fresh and hardened concrete in accordance with the following \nmethods: \n Slump. Tex-415-A\n, only for formed concrete pavement placements; \n Air Content. Tex-414-A  or Tex-416-A, only when air-entrained concrete is shown on the plans; \n Temperature. Tex-422-A; \n Making and Curing Strength Specimens. Tex-447-A; \n Compressive Strength. Tex-418-A; and \n Maturity. Tex-426-A. \nMaturity specimens will be made only when maturity method is used or shown on the plans. \nConcrete with slump less than minimum required after all addition of water withheld will be rejected, unless \notherwise allowed by the Engineer. Concrete with slump exceeding maximum allowed may be used at the \nContractor’s option. If used, Engineer will make, test, and evaluate strength specimens in accordance with \nSection 360.4.15., “Acceptance of Concrete Pavement.” Acceptance of concrete not meeting air content or \ntemperature requirements will be determined by Engineer. Fresh concrete exhibiting segregation and \nexcessive bleeding will be rejected. \n4.14.2.1. Strength Specimen Handling. After strength test specimens are molded, protect and cure in conformance \nwith pertinent test methods. When necessary, deliver Contractor-molded specimens to curing facilities, \nremove specimens from their molds, and place specimens in curing tanks within 24–48 hr. after molding, in \nconformance with pertinent test methods. The Engineer will deliver Department-molded specimens to curing \nfacilities, remove specimens from their molds, and place specimens in curing tanks within 24–48 hr. after \nmolding, in conformance with pertinent test methods.  \n4.15. Acceptance of Concrete Pavement. The Engineer will determine pay adjustments for deficient pavement \nthickness within 14 days after concrete pavement has been cored. The Engineer will determine structural \nadequacy of low concrete strengths within 7 days after design strength specimens or cores, if taken, are \ntested. \n4.15.1. Pavement Thickness. The Engineer will check the thickness in accordance with Tex-423-A\n unless other \nmethods are shown on the plans. The Engineer will perform one thickness test consisting of one reading at \napproximately the center of the paving equipment every 500 ft. or fraction thereof. Core where directed, in \naccordance with \nTex-424-A, to verify deficiencies. Do not core until pavement is at least 7 days old or has \nachieved design strength. Fill core holes using an approved concrete mixture and method. \n4.15.1.1. Assessing Payment Adjustments. Limits for applying a payment adjustment for deficient pavement \nthickness are 500 ft. units of pavement in each lane. Lane width will be as shown on typical sections and in \nconformance with pavement design standards. \nThe limits for retaining deficient pavement without compensation or removing and replacing without \nadditional compensation will be defined by coring or equivalent nondestructive means as determined by the \nEngineer. The remaining portion of the 500-ft. unit allowed for pay adjustment will be subject to the payment \nadjustment based on the average core thickness deficiency at each end of the 10-ft. interval investigation as \ndetermined by the Engineer. \nShoulders will be measured for thickness unless otherwise shown on the plans. Shoulders 6 ft. wide or wider \nwill be considered as lanes. Shoulders less than 6 ft. wide will be considered part of the adjacent lane. \nShoulders less than 6 ft. wide and placed separately from the adjacent lane will be considered as a lane. \nLimits for applying payment adjustment for deficient pavement thickness for ramps, widenings, acceleration \nand deceleration lanes, and other miscellaneous areas are 500-ft. units. Areas less than 500-ft. units will be \nindividually evaluated for payment adjustment based on the plan area. \n\n2024 Specifications  360 \n458 \n4.15.1.2. Verification of Thickness Deficiencies. When any fresh depth test measured in accordance with \nTex-423-A\n is deficient by more than 0.50 in. from the plan thickness, take one 4-in. diameter core at that \nlocation to verify the measurement. \nWhen determining the average thickness deficiency for assessing a pay adjustment other than retaining \npavement without compensation or remove and replace as shown in Table 1, take at least two additional \ncores from the unit, in accordance with Section 360.4.15.1.1., “Assessing Payment Adjustments,” \nequidistantly spaced from the first core in each direction if the first core is deficient by more than 0.50 in. from \nthe plan thickness. Measure the length of cores in accordance with Tex-424-A\n. Determine the average \nthickness by averaging the lengths of the cores. Subtract the calculated average thickness from the plan \nthickness to determine the average thickness deficiency. In calculations of the average thickness, \nmeasurements exceeding the plan thickness by more than 0.2 in. will be considered as the plan thickness \nplus 0.2 in.  \nWhen determining the limits for retaining the deficient pavement without compensation or remove and \nreplace without additional compensation, take additional cores at 10-ft. intervals in each direction parallel to \nthe centerline to determine the boundary of the deficient area if the first core length deficiency is more than \n1.00 in. for pavements less than 11 in. thick or more than 1.50 in. for pavements 11 in. or thicker. Continue \ntaking cores at 10-ft. intervals until the core length deficiency is less than 1.00 in. for pavements less than \n11 in. thick or less than 1.50 in. for pavements 11 in. or thicker.  \n4.15.2. Strength of Concrete Pavement. The Engineer will accept concrete pavement meeting a compressive \nstrength of 3,200 psi at 7 days or meeting a compressive strength of 4,000 psi at 28 days for Class P \nconcrete. \nConcrete strength testing may be correlated to an age other than 7 days in accordance with Tex-427-A\n when \napproved. \nThe Engineer will accept concrete pavement using Class HES concrete based on the required strength and \ntime. \nInvestigate the strength test procedures, the quality of materials, the concrete production operations, and \nother possible problem areas to determine the cause when a concrete strength test value is more than 10% \nbelow the required strength or when three consecutive strength values fall below the required strength. Take \nnecessary action to correct the problem, including redesign of the concrete mix if needed. The Engineer may \nsuspend concrete paving if the Contractor is unable to identify, document, and correct the cause of \nlow-strength test values in a timely manner. The Engineer will evaluate the structural adequacy of the \npavements if any strength is more than 15% below the required strength. Remove and replace pavements \nfound to be structurally inadequate at no additional cost when directed. \n4.15.3. Ride Quality. Measure and correct ride quality in accordance with Item 585, unless otherwise shown on the \nplans. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nThis Item will be measured as follows. \n5.1. Concrete Pavement. Concrete pavement will be measured by the square yard of surface area in place. The \nsurface area includes the portion of the pavement slab extending beneath the curb. \n6.

DESCRIPTION \nExcavate for placement and construction of structures and backfill structures. Cut and restore pavement. \n2. MATERIALS \nUse materials that meet the requirements of the following. \n Item 401, “Flowable Backfill” \n Item 421, “Hydraulic Cement Concrete” \n DMS-4600\n, “Hydraulic Cement” \n3. CONSTRUCTION \n3.1. Excavation. \n3.1.1. General. Excavate to the lines and grades shown on the plans or as directed. Provide slopes, benching, \nsheeting, bracing, pumping, and bailing as necessary to maintain the stability and safety of excavations up to \n5   ft. deep. Excavation protection for excavations deeper than 5 ft. is governed by Item 402, “Trench \nExcavation Protection,” and Item 403, “Temporary Special Shoring.” Use satisfactory excavated material as \nbackfill or as embankment fill in accordance with Item 132, “Embankment.” Dispose of material not \nincorporated into the final project off the right of way in conformance with federal, state, and local regulations. \nKeep any topsoil that has been removed separate, and replace it, as nearly as feasible, in its original position \nwhen excavating for installation of structures across private property or beyond the limits of the embankment. \nRestore the area to an acceptable condition. \nExcavate drilled shafts in accordance with Item 416, “Drilled Shaft Foundations.” \n3.1.1.1. Obstructions. Remove obstructions to the proposed construction, including trees and other vegetation, \ndebris, and structures, over the width of the excavation to a depth of 1 ft. below the bottom of excavation. \nRemove as required to clear the new structure and plug in an approved manner if abandoned storm drains, \nsewers, or other drainage systems are encountered. Restore the bottom of the excavation to grade by \nbackfilling after removing obstructions in accordance with this Item. Dispose of surplus materials in \nconformance with federal, state, and local regulations. \n3.1.1.2. Excavation in Streets. Cut pavement and base to neat lines when structures are installed in streets, \nhighways, or other paved areas. Restore pavement structure after completion of excavation and backfilling. \nMaintain and control traffic in accordance with the approved traffic control plan and the TMUTCD. \n3.1.1.3. Utilities. Comply with the requirements of Article 7.15., “Responsibility for Damage Claims.” Conduct work \nwith minimum disturbance of existing utilities, and coordinate work in or near utilities with the utility owners. \nInform utility owners before work begins, allowing them enough time to identify, locate, reroute, or make \nother adjustments to utility lines. \nAvoid cutting or damaging underground utility lines that are to remain in place. Promptly notify the utility \ncompany if damage occurs. Provide temporary flumes across the excavation while open if an active sanitary \n\n2024 Specifications  400 \n466 \nsewer line is damaged during excavation and restore the lines when backfilling has progressed to the original \nbedding lines of the cut sewer. \n3.1.1.4. De-Watering. Construct or place structures in the presence of water only if approved. Place precast \nmembers, pipe, and concrete only on a dry, firm surface. Remove water by bailing, pumping, well point \ninstallation, deep wells, underdrains, or other approved method. \nRemove standing water in a manner that does not allow water movement through or alongside concrete \nbeing placed if structures are approved for placement in the presence of water. Pump or bail only from a \nsuitable sump separated from the concrete work while placing structural concrete or for a period of at least \n36 hr. thereafter. Pump or bail during placement of seal concrete only to the extent necessary to maintain a \nstatic head of water within the cofferdam. Pump or bail to de-water inside a sealed cofferdam only after the \nseal has aged at least 36 hr. \nPlace a stabilizing material in the bottom of the excavation if the bottom cannot be de-watered to the point \nthe subgrade is free of mud or it is difficult to keep reinforcing steel clean. Use flexible base, \ncement-stabilized base or backfill, lean concrete, or other approved stabilizing material. Provide concrete \nwith at least 275 lb. of cement per cubic yard, if lean concrete is used, and place to a minimum depth of 3 in.    \nStabilizing material placed for the convenience of the Contractor will be at the Contractor’s expense. \n3.1.2. Bridge Foundations and Retaining Walls. Do not disturb material below the bottom of footing grade. Do \nnot backfill to compensate for excavation that has extended below grade. Fill the area with concrete at the \ntime the footing is placed if excavation occurs below the proposed footing grade. Additional concrete placed \nwill be at the Contractor’s expense. \nTake core samples to determine the character of the supporting materials if requested. Provide an intact \nsample adequate to judge the character of the founding material. Take these cores when the excavation is \nclose to completion. Cores should be approximately 5 ft. deeper than the proposed founding grade. \nRemove loose material if the founding stratum is rock or other hard material, and clean and cut it to a firm \nsurface that is level, stepped, or serrated, as directed. Clean out soft seams, and fill with concrete when the \nfooting is placed. \nPlace the foundation once the Engineer has inspected the excavation and authorized changes have been \nmade to provide a uniform bearing condition if the material at the footing grade of a retaining wall, bridge \nbent, or pier is a mixture of compressible and incompressible material. \n3.1.3. Cofferdams. The term “cofferdam” designates any temporary or removable structure constructed to hold \nsurrounding earth, water, or both out of the excavation whether the structure is formed of soil, timber, steel, \nconcrete, or a combination of these. Use pumping wells or well points for de-watering cofferdams if required. \nSubmit details and design calculations for sheet pile or other types of cofferdams requiring structural \nmembers bearing the seal, signature, and date of a licensed professional engineer for review before \nconstructing the cofferdam. The Department reserves the right to reject designs. Design structural systems to \ncomply with the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges or AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design \nSpecifications. Interior dimensions of cofferdams must provide enough clearance for the construction, \ninspection, and removal of required forms and, if necessary, enough room to allow pumping outside the \nforms. Extend sheet pile cofferdams well below the bottom of the footings and make concrete seals as \nwell-braced and watertight as practicable. \nUse Class E concrete for foundation seals unless otherwise specified. Place concrete foundation seals in \naccordance with Item 420, “Concrete Substructures.” Seals placed for the convenience of the Contractor will \nbe at the Contractor’s expense. \nMake the excavation deep enough to allow for swelling of the material at the base of the excavation during \npile-driving operations when the Engineer judges it to be impractical to de-water inside a cofferdam and a \nconcrete seal is to be placed around piling driven within the cofferdam. Remove swelling material to the \n\n2024 Specifications  400 \n467 \nbottom of the seal grade after driving the piling. Remove the foundation material to exact footing grades \nwhere it is possible to de-water inside the cofferdam without placing a seal after driving piling. Do not backfill \na foundation to compensate for excavation that has been extended below grade; fill such areas below grade \nwith concrete at the time the seals or footings are placed. \nRemove cofferdams after completing the substructure without disturbing or damaging the structure unless \notherwise provided. \n3.1.4. Culverts and Storm Drains. When the design requires special bedding conditions for culverts or storm \ndrains, an excavation diagram will be shown on the plans. Do not exceed these limits of excavation. \nConstruct pipe structures in an open cut with vertical sides extending to a point 1 ft. above the pipe unless \notherwise shown on the plans. When site conditions or the plans do not prohibit sloping the cut, the \nexcavation may be stepped or laid back to a stable slope beginning 1 ft. above the pipe. Maintain the stability \nof the excavation throughout the construction period. \nConstruct the embankment for pipe to be installed in fill above natural ground to an elevation at least 1 ft. \nabove the top of the pipe, and then excavate for the pipe. \n3.1.4.1. Unstable Material. Remove the material to a depth of no more than 2 ft. below the grade of the structure \nwhen unstable soil is encountered at established footing grade, unless the Engineer authorizes additional \ndepth. Replace soil removed with stable material in uniform layers no greater than 8 in.    deep (loose \nmeasurement). Each layer must have enough moisture to be compacted by rolling or tamping as required to \nprovide a stable foundation for the structure. \nUse special materials such as flexible base, cement-stabilized base, cement-stabilized backfill, or other \napproved material when it is not feasible to construct a stable foundation as outlined above. \n3.1.4.2. Incompressible Material. Remove the incompressible material to 6 in.    below the footing grade, backfill with \nan approved compressible material, and compact in accordance with Section 400.3.3., “Backfill,” if rock, part \nrock, or other incompressible material is encountered at established footing grade while placing prefabricated \nelements. \n3.2. Shaping and Bedding.  \n3.2.1. General. Place at least 2 in.    of fine granular material for precast box sections on the base of the excavation \nbefore placing the box sections. Use bedding as shown in Figure 1 for pipe installations. Use Class C \nbedding unless otherwise shown on the plans. The Engineer may require the use of a template to secure \nreasonably accurate shaping of the foundation material. Undercut the excavation at least 4 in.    where \ncement-stabilized backfill is shown on the plans and backfill with stabilized material to support the pipe or box \nat the required grade.  \n\n2024 Specifications  400 \n468 \n \nFigure 1 \nBedding Diagrams \n3.2.2. Optional Shaping and Bedding for Precast Concrete Pipe. For precast concrete pipe, the beddings in \naccordance with ASTM C1479 are permissible. \n3.3. Backfill. \n3.3.1. General. Backfill the excavation after placement of the permanent structure as soon as practical. Use backfill \nfree of stones large enough to interfere with compaction; large or frozen lumps that will not break down \nreadily under compaction; and wood or other extraneous material. Obtain backfill material from excavation or \nfrom other sources. \nPlace backfill in layers no greater than 10 in.    deep (loose measurement) in areas not supporting a completed \nroadbed, retaining wall, or embankment. Place backfill in uniform layers no greater than 8 in.    deep (loose \nmeasurement) in areas supporting a portion of a roadbed, retaining wall, or embankment. Compact each \n\n2024 Specifications  400 \n469 \nlayer to meet the density requirements of the roadbed, retaining wall, or embankment material, or as shown \non the plans. \nBring each layer of backfill material to the moisture content needed to obtain the required density. Use \nmechanical tamps or rammers to compact the backfill. Rollers may be used to compact backfill if feasible. \nCohesionless materials may be used for backfilling. Use cohesionless materials that conform to the \nrequirements shown in Table 1. \nTable 1 \nCohesionless Material Gradation Limits \nSieve Size Percent Retained \n3′′ 0 \n#10 Note 1 \n#200 90–100 \n1. No. 10 sieve requirements are 0–30% retained when used as aggregate for \ncement-stabilized backfill. \nCompact cohesionless materials using vibratory equipment, water ponding, or a combination of both. \n3.3.2. Bridge Foundations, Retaining Walls, Manholes and Inlets, and Box Culverts. Place backfill against the \nstructure only after the concrete has reached the design strength required in Item 421. \nBackfill retaining walls with material meeting the requirements of Item 423, “Retaining Walls.” Backfill around \nbridge foundations, manholes and inlets, and culverts using material with particles no more than 4 in. in \ngreatest dimension and a gradation that permits thorough compaction. Use rock or gravel mixed with soil if \nthe percentage of fines is enough to fill all voids and ensure a uniform and thoroughly compacted mass of \nproper density. \nUse mechanical tamps and rammers to avoid damage to the structure where backfill material is being placed \ntoo close to the structure to permit compaction with blading and rolling equipment. \nAvoid wedging action of backfill against structures. Step or serrate slopes bounding the excavation to prevent \nsuch action. Place backfill uniformly around bridge foundations. Place backfill equally and in uniform layers \nalong both sides of manholes and inlets and culverts. \nThe Engineer may require backfilling of structures excavated into hard, erosion-resistant material, and \nsubject to erosive forces, with stone or lean concrete. \nBox culverts may be opened to traffic as soon as enough backfill and embankment have been placed over \nthe top to protect culverts against damage from heavy construction equipment. Repair damage to culvert \ncaused by construction traffic at no additional expense to the Department. \n3.3.3. Pipe. Bring backfill material to the proper moisture condition after installing bedding and pipe as required and \nplace it equally along both sides of the pipe in uniform layers no greater than 8 in. deep (loose \nmeasurement). Compact each lift mechanically. Thoroughly compact materials placed under the haunches of \nthe pipe to prevent damage or displacement of the pipe. Place backfill in this manner to the top-of-pipe \nelevation. Place and compact backfill above the top of the pipe in accordance with Section 400.3.3.1., \n“General.” \nThe Engineer may reject backfill material containing more than 20% by weight of material retained on a 3-in. \nsieve with large lumps not easily broken down or that cannot be spread in loose layers. Material excavated \nby trenching machine must generally meet the requirements of this Section as long as large stones are not \npresent. \nPlace and compact additional material where pipe extends beyond the toe of slope of the embankment and \nthe depth of cover provided by backfill to the original ground level is less than the minimum required by the \nspecifications for the type of pipe involved, until the minimum cover has been provided. \n\n2024 Specifications  400 \n470 \n3.3.4. Cement-Stabilized Backfill. Backfill the excavation to the elevations shown with cement-stabilized backfill \nwhen shown on the plans. Use cement-stabilized backfill that contains aggregate conforming to the gradation \nlimits shown in Table 1, water, and at least 7% hydraulic cement based on the dry weight of the aggregate, in \naccordance with Tex-120-E\n. \nPlace cement-stabilized backfill equally along the sides of structures to prevent strain on or displacement of \nthe structure. Fill voids when placing cement-stabilized backfill. Use hand-operated tampers,  if necessary, to \nfill voids. Compact the mixture using density control unless otherwise shown on the plans. Place and \ncompact the backfill within 2 hr. of mixing.  \n3.3.5. Flowable Backfill. Backfill the excavation with flowable backfill to the elevations indicated when shown on \nthe plans. Prevent the structure from being displaced during the placement of the flowable fill, and prevent \nflowable fill from entering manholes and inlets, culverts, and drainage structures. \n4. MEASUREMENT \nThis is a plans quantity measurement Item. The quantity to be paid is the quantity shown in the proposal, \nunless modified by Article 9.2., “Plans Quantity Measurement.” Additional measurements or calculations will \nbe made if adjustments of quantities are required. \n4.1.

DESCRIPTION \nDrive piling. \n2. EQUIPMENT \n2.1. Driving Equipment. Use power hammers for driving piling with specified bearing resistance. Use power \nhammers that comply with Table 1. Gravity hammers may be used for driving sheet piling and timber piling if \nno required design load is shown on the plans. \nFor initial rating of diesel hammers to determine compliance with the requirements shown in Table 1, the \nheight of fall of the ram of the single-acting (open-end) hammer must be 7 ft. For a double-acting (enclosed \nram) hammer, the energy rating must be 85% of the rated output by the manufacturer. \nA hammer that produces less energy than required in Table 1 may be approved if a wave equation analysis \nindicates the hammer can drive the specified pile against a bearing resistance of three times the required \ndesign load before reaching 0.1 in. of penetration per blow. The bearing resistance of the piling driven with \nthis particular equipment will be determined in accordance with the Wave Equation Method. \nUse an air compressor that supplies the volume and pressure specified by the manufacturer of the hammer. \nProvide an accurate pressure gauge. \nMaintain the valve mechanism and other parts of power hammers so the hammer will operate at the speed \nand stroke length specified by the manufacturer. \nEquip enclosed ram diesel hammers with a gauge and provide charts to evaluate the equivalent energy \nbeing produced. Calibrate the gauge before work begins, whenever gauge accuracy is in question, and at \nleast once each 6 mo. \nTable 1 \nSize of Driving Equipment \nPiling  \nType \nHammer  \nType \nRam Weight  \n(lb.) \nMax Ram  \nStroke (ft.) \nMin Hammer Energy  \n(ft.-lb.)\n1\n \nTimber \nAir, Hydraulic 2,000 Min 5 330R \nDiesel 2,000 Min 10 330R \nSteel \nAir, Hydraulic 3,000 Min 5 Larger of 250R or 2-1/2 Wp \nDiesel 2,000 Min 10 Larger of 250R or 2-1/2 Wp \nConcrete \nAir, Hydraulic \n3,000 Min, but  \nnot less than 1/4 Wp \n5 \n250R, but not less than 1 ft.-lb.  \nper pound of pile weight \nDiesel \n2,700 Min, but  \nnot less than 1/4 Wp \n8\n2\n \n250R, but not less than 1 ft.-lb.  \nper pound of pile weight \n1. R = Design load in tons. Wp = Weight of pile in pounds based on plan length. \n2. Diesel hammers with less ram weight or greater ram stroke are permitted if a wave equation analysis indicates \nthe combination of ram weight, stroke, and cushioning will not overstress the piling. \nProvide hammer cushion consisting of layers of micarta and aluminum or other material specifically produced \nand approved for this application. Use a wood, wire rope, or asbestos hammer cushion only if permitted. \nRegulate the height of fall when using gravity hammers to avoid damage to the piling. \n\n2024 Specifications  404 \n479 \nDrive all test piling in a structure or in any approved segment of it using the same hammer, and use the same \ntype and size of hammer to drive the remainder of the piling in the structure or segment. \nEquip pile drivers with leads constructed to allow freedom of movement of the hammer and to provide \nadequate support to the pile during driving. The longitudinal axis of the leads, hammer, and pile should \ncoincide. \nEnsure leads are long enough, except where piling is driven through water, that a follower will not be \nnecessary. Use one pile in every 10 that is long enough to permit driving without a follower when driving \npiling underwater and a follower is required. Drive it as a test pile for proper correlation of the follower-driven \npiling. Payment will be made as regular piling. \nHammers designed to operate underwater may be used for underwater driving without a follower and without \nthe correlation required for other hammers. \n2.2. Protection of Pile Heads. Use a steel driving head (helmet) suitable for the type and size of piling. Drive \nsteel H-piling and sheet piling using a helmet compatible with the specific pile shape driven. \nProvide a cushion block for concrete piling between the driving head and the top of the pile. Use a cushion \nblock that is at least 4 in. thick for short piling (50 ft. or less) and at least 6 in. thick for longer piling, unless \notherwise directed. Use multiple layers of one of the following: \n 3/4-in. or 1-in. structural-grade southern pine or fir plywood; \n green oak or gum, with the grain of the wood horizontal; or \n other approved material specifically produced for this application. \nPay special attention to the condition of the cushioning material. Drive no more than three piles using one \ncushion block. Change cushioning more frequently if necessary to prevent damage. Immediately replace any \ncushion block that has ignited. Do not use a tight-fitting driving helmet for concrete piling. Allow room for \nslight movement, but ensure the driving helmet is not large enough for the pile head to rotate freely. Center \nconcrete piling and cushion within the helmet throughout the driving operation. \n3. CONSTRUCTION \nThis Item uses the following terms. \n Foundation Piling. Piling placed under interior bent footings or retaining wall abutment footings. \n Trestle Piling. Piling embedded directly into the abutment cap or interior bent cap. \n Sheet Piling. Retaining piling not considered either foundation or trestle piling. \n Test Piling. Specific piling driven to investigate site conditions and determine regular piling lengths. \n Test-Loaded Piling. Specific piling driven and test-loaded to investigate site conditions and determine \nregular piling lengths. Do not fabricate regular piling until test loading and analysis are completed. \n Regular Piling. All piling other than test piling and test-loaded piling. \nDo not fabricate regular piling until test pile driving and analysis or test loading and analysis are completed. \nComplete the embankment at bridge ends before driving abutment piling. Refer to Item 423, “Retaining \nWalls,” for provisions pertinent to piling that passes through the structural volume of retaining walls. \nDo not drive foundation piling until the footing excavation is complete. Drive concrete piling once the piling \nconcrete, including buildups, has cured at least 14 days. Do not drive piling in a saltwater environment until \nthe piling concrete, including buildups, has cured at least 21 days after concrete placement. \nRe-drive any piling that is raised when driving adjacent piling. Withdraw and replace any broken, split, or \ndisplaced piling, or correct it as directed after a design analysis. \n\n2024 Specifications  404 \n480 \nTo control excessive stresses resulting in damage to the piling during driving, the following, alone or in \ncombination, may be required: \n increase in cushion thickness, \n reduction of ram stroke, \n heavier ram with a shorter stroke, \n use of pilot holes or jetting when driving through hard or alternating hard and soft strata. \n3.1. Tolerance for Driving. Drive piling to the required vertical or batter alignment, within the tolerances in \naccordance with this Section. Drive piling with rigid templates when using swinging leads or when necessary \nto comply with tolerances. Drive battered piles using a two-tiered template or a template equipped with a \ndevice to hold the pile at the required batter. Construct the template to allow the pile to pass freely through \nthe template without binding. Cut off piling reasonably square at the elevation shown on the plans, with a \ntolerance of no more than 2 in. above or below established cutoff grade. Submit for approval a structural \nanalysis and proposed corrective action, signed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer, when \ntolerances are exceeded and the Engineer requires corrective action. \n3.1.1. Trestle Piling. \n Transverse to the centerline of the bent, the top of the piling may be no more than 2 in. from the position \nshown on the plans. \n Parallel to the centerline of the bent, the top of the piling may be no more than 4 in. from the position \nshown on the plans. \n3.1.2. Foundation Piling. \n The top of each pile may be no more than 4 in. in any direction from the position shown on the plans. \n The center of gravity of the piling group may be no more than 3 in. from the center of gravity determined \nfrom plan location. \n The minimum edge distance for piling in a footing is 5 in. Additional concrete required to obtain this \nedge distance and specified reinforcing steel cover will be at the Contractor’s expense. \n3.2. Penetration. Piling lengths shown on the plans are the lengths estimated to provide required bearing and for \nestimating purposes only. Drive piling to plan tip elevations or to greater depths as necessary to obtain the \nrequired allowable dynamic resistance meeting or exceeding the foundation load shown on the plans. \nThe Engineer will establish regular pile lengths based on the test data when test piling or test-loaded piling is \nused. Drive regular piling to this approximate elevation in these cases and to greater depths as required to \nobtain the plan bearing resistance. \nProvide either pilot holes, jetting, or a combination of both for unusually hard driving conditions, typically less \nthan 0.1 in. of penetration per blow if plan penetration is not obtained. Reduce penetration upon approval \nwhen the piling is advanced to within 5 ft. of plan length, unless other penetration requirements or bearing \nevaluation methods govern. \n3.3. Pilot Holes. Extend pilot holes no more than 5 ft. below the bottom of footings for foundation piling or 10 ft. \nbelow finished ground line for trestle piling, unless the specified penetration cannot be obtained by using the \ndepth of holes indicated or specified. The maximum hole diameter permitted will be approximately 4 in. less \nthan the diagonal of square piling or steel H-piling and 1 in. less than the diameter of round piling. Determine \nthe size and depth of pilot holes from the results of trial operations on the first piling driven or from available \ntest pile data when deeper ones are required. Obtain approval for any depth or size of pilot holes that \nexceeds the maximums specified in this Section. The Engineer may vary hole size and depth to obtain \npenetration and bearing resistance. \nExtend pilot holes through all embankments to natural ground when driving concrete piling. \n\n2024 Specifications  404 \n481 \nWhere a pilot hole is required in granular material that cannot be sealed off by ordinary drilling methods, a \ncasing may be required around the boring device deep enough to prevent loose material from falling into the \npilot hole. \nDrive the piling below the depth of the pilot hole at least 1 ft. or 100 blows, but not less than the required \nbearing resistance shown on the plans. Do not drive piling beyond the point where the penetration per blow \nis less than 0.1 in. as determined by an average of 10 blows, unless directed otherwise. Stop driving if \ndamage to the pile is apparent. \n3.4. Jetting. Jetting is permitted when the specified penetration cannot be obtained by driving and pilot holes or \nother methods are not feasible. Submit details of the proposed methods for approval before jetting. The \nEngineer may authorize varying depths of jetting to achieve the desired results. \nJet as required in conjunction with driving but only to the approved depth. Use enough power for jetting \noperations to simultaneously operate at least two 2-1/2 in. diameter pipes equipped with 3/4-in. nozzles at a \npressure of 150 psi. Perform the jetting with one or two jets as determined and approved from results of trial \noperations. \nDrive the piling below the depth of the jetting at least 1 ft. or 100 blows, but not less than the required bearing \nresistance shown on the plans. Do not drive piling beyond the point where the penetration per blow is less \nthan 0.1 in. as determined by an average of 10 blows, unless directed otherwise. Stop driving if damage to \nthe pile is apparent. \n3.5. Hammer Formula Method of Bearing Evaluation. Determine the allowable dynamic bearing resistance of \npiling by one of the hammer formulas in this Section unless otherwise shown on the plans. If the Engineer \nhas determined a K factor based on test piling, test-loaded piling, or other methods, the computed allowable \nresistance will be the driving resistance determined based on the appropriate formula multiplied by the \nK   factor. The computed allowable resistance should be greater than or equal to the foundation load shown \non the plans. \n3.5.1. Single-Acting Power Hammers. Use the following formula. \n=\na\nP\n1.0\n2\n+S\nWH\n \nwhere: \nP\na\n = allowable dynamic resistance in pounds \nW = weight of ram in pounds \nH = height of fall of ram in feet (field-measured) \nS = average penetration in inches per blow for the last 20 blows \nDetermine H by an approved electronic stroke indicator and blow count logging device provided by the \nContractor. Pending approval, H can be determined by visual observation of the ram against a calibrated rod \nmounted on the hammer, or by the following formula. \n3.0\n30\n1.16\n2\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×=\nB\nH\n \nwhere: \nB = blows per minute \n3.5.2. Double-Acting Power Hammers. Use the following formula. \n=\na\nP\n1.0\n2\n+S\nE\n \n\n2024 Specifications  404 \n482 \nwhere: \nP\na\n = allowable dynamic resistance in pounds \nE = manufacturer’s rated energy in foot-pounds (for double-acting power hammers), or the equivalent energy \nin foot-pounds determined by a calibrated gauge attached to the hammer and taken when the average \npenetration in inches per blow is determined (for enclosed ram diesel hammer) \nS = average penetration in inches per blow for the last 20 blows \n3.5.3. Other Hammer Types. Provide a wave equation analysis for each pile, hammer, soil, and load combination \nfor which the driving system is to be used. The analysis will determine the bearing capacity of the piling. \n3.6. Wave Equation Method of Bearing Evaluation. Submit the following data when the plans specify the \nbearing capacity of the piling is    determined by the wave equation method: \n manufacturer’s specification data for the hammer proposed for use, including all modifications and \n complete description and dimensions of all cushioning material used between the pile and helmet and in \nthe cap block, including total thickness of each, and the direction of grain if wood is used. \nThese data will be used by the Engineer to determine the required number of blows per unit of penetration \nthe hammer must deliver to obtain the required bearing resistance. \nAfter evaluation by the wave equation method, any change in the driving equipment may require \nreevaluation. Such changes must be approved before further driving. \n3.7. Test Piling. Drive test piling at locations shown on the plans or as directed. Make test piling part of the \ncompleted work, cut off or built up to grade as necessary. Use the required bearing evaluation method to \ndetermine bearing resistance. \nInitially drive test piling to 3 ft. above plan tip elevation of the regular piling for the structure with the blow \ncount recorded for each foot of driving. (For example, drive test piling to 13 ft. above its plan tip elevation if \nthe test piling is 10 ft. longer than regular piling.) Retain the cushion if used. \nRe-drive the test piling the additional length required by the plans at least 7 days after the original driving \nusing the same hammer and cushion originally used. Record the blow count for each inch of driving for the \nfirst foot, for every 3 in. for the next 2 ft., and for each foot thereafter. \nProvide the data to the Engineer for use in determining regular piling lengths and K factors. The K factor will \nbe determined based on the following formula. \nPPK\nR=\n  \nwhere: \nK = a static correction factor applied to the evaluation method \nP\nR \n= re-drive bearing (ton) of the test pile determined by the evaluation method \nP = original bearing (ton) of test pile determined by the evaluation method \n3.8. Test-Loaded Piling. Conduct test load in accordance with Item 405, “Foundation Load Test.” \nProvide the data to the Engineer for use in determining regular piling lengths and K factors. The K factor will \nbe determined based on the following formula. \nPLK=\n \nwhere: \nK = a static correction factor applied to the evaluation method \nL = maximum safe static load proven by test load \nP = bearing resistance of the test-loaded pile determined by the evaluation method \n\n2024 Specifications  404 \n483 \n4.

DESCRIPTION \nConstruct foundations consisting of reinforced or non-reinforced concrete drilled shafts. \n2. MATERIALS \nUse materials that meet the requirements of the following Items. \n Item 421, “Hydraulic Cement Concrete” \n Item 440, “Reinforcement for Concrete” \n Item 448, “Structural Field Welding” \nUse concrete for drilled shafts that meets the requirements shown in   Table 1 unless otherwise shown on the \nplans. \nTable 1 \nConcrete for Drilled Shafts \nDrilled Shaft Type Concrete \nNon-reinforced Class A \nReinforced Class C \nSlurry and underwater concrete placement Class SS \nUse coarse aggregate Grade 4, 5, or 6 for drilled shaft concrete in reinforced drilled shafts. Grade 2 or \nGrade 3 may be used if the shaft is dry and reinforcing steel has a 5 in.    minimum clear spacing. \nUse a water-reducing, retarding admixture in accordance with DMS-4640\n, “Chemical Admixtures for \nConcrete,” in all concrete when using casing that will be pulled or when placing shafts under water or under \nslurry. \nUse concrete with slump that meets the requirements shown in Table 2 as determined in accordance with \nTex-415-A\n. \nTable 2 \nSlump Requirements \nPlacement  \nType \nMin Acceptable \nPlacement Slump \n(in.) \nRecommended Design \nand Placement Slump \n(in.) \nMax Acceptable  \nPlacement Slump \n(in.) \nDry 5-1/2 6-1/2 7-1/2 \nUnderwater and \nunder slurry \n7 8 9 \nPerform a slump loss test in accordance with Tex-430-A before beginning work when casing is to be pulled \nor concrete is to be placed underwater or under slurry. Provide concrete that will maintain a slump of at least \n4   in.    throughout the entire anticipated time of concrete placement. Time of concrete placement is in \naccordance with Section 416.3.6., “Concrete,” and Section 416.3.7., “Additional Requirements for Slurry \nDisplacement or Underwater Concrete Placement Methods.” Note the temperature of the concrete mix at the \nbeginning of the slump loss test. Place the concrete if its temperature at the time of placement into the drilled \nshaft is no more than 10°F higher than the slump loss test temperature. Use ice or other concrete-cooling \ningredients to lower concrete temperature or run additional slump loss tests at the higher temperatures. \nSlump loss testing will be waived if anticipated time of concrete placement is less than 90 min. \n\n2024 Specifications  416 \n501 \nUse mineral drilling slurry that meets the requirements shown in Table 3, as determined in accordance with \nTex-130-E. Determine pH of slurry in accordance with Tex-128-E\n or using pH paper strips. \n \nTable 3 \nMineral Slurry Requirements \nBefore Introduction \ninto Excavation \nSampled from Bottom of \nExcavation Before Concreting \nSpecific \nGravity \nSand \nContent \npH \nSpecific \nGravity \nViscosity \n(sec.) \nSand \nContent \n≤1.10 ≤1% 8–  11 ≤1.15 ≤45 ≤4% \nUse mineral slurry consisting of processed bentonite or attapulgite clays mixed with clean fresh water. Do not \nuse partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) polymeric slurry or any other fluid composed primarily of a \npolymer solution. \nIf approved, water may be used as the drilling fluid. In this case, all the provisions shown in Table 3 must be \nmet,  except that the maximum specific gravity is not to exceed 1.12. \nSample slurry from the bottom of the hole, before placing concrete, and test it in accordance with Tex-130-E\n. \nUse a pump or air lift to remove slurry that does not meet the requirements shown in Table 3 while adding \nfresh clean slurry to the top of the hole to maintain the slurry level. Continue this operation until the slurry \nsampled from the bottom of the hole meets the requirements. \n3. CONSTRUCTION \nSubmit drilled shaft installation plan for review no later than 1 mo. before drilled shaft construction. Include \nthe following in the plan: \n name and experience record of the drilled shaft superintendent who will be in charge of drilled shaft \noperations for the project; \n list of proposed equipment to be used, including cranes, drills, augers, bailing buckets, final cleaning \nequipment, de-sanding equipment, slurry pumps, core-sampling equipment, tremies or concrete pumps, \nand casing; \n details of overall construction operation sequence and the sequence of shaft construction in bents or \ngroups; \n details of shaft excavation methods; \n when the use of slurry is anticipated, details of the slurry mix design and its suitability for the subsurface \nconditions at the construction site, mixing and storage methods, maintenance methods,  and disposal \nprocedures; \n details of methods to clean the shaft excavation; \n details of reinforcement placement, including support and centralization methods; \n details of concrete placement, including proposed operational procedures for free-fall, tremie,  or \npumping methods; and \n details of casing installation and removal methods. \nThe installation plan will be reviewed for conformance with the plans, specifications,  and special provisions. \nThe Contractor will be notified within 14 days of receipt of the installation plan of any additional information \nrequired or changes necessary to meet the Contract requirements. All procedural approvals will be subject to \ntrial in the field and will not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to satisfactorily complete the work as \nshown on the plans and in conformance with specifications. \nPlace the shaft to within the following tolerances. \n Vertical plumbness: 1   in.    per 10 ft. of depth \n Center of shaft located under column: 1   in.    of horizontal plan position \n\n2024 Specifications  416 \n502 \n Center of shaft located under footing: 3 in.    of horizontal plan position \nComplete the embankment at bridge ends before installing drilled shafts that pass through the fill. Refer to \nItem 423, “Retaining Walls,” for provisions for drilled shafts passing through the structural volume of retaining \nwalls. \n3.1. Excavation. The plans indicate the expected depths and elevations for encountering satisfactory bearing \nmaterial. Excavate as required for the shafts through all materials encountered to the dimensions and \nelevations shown on the plans or required by the site conditions. Removal of man-made obstructions not \nshown on the plans will be paid for in accordance with Article 9.7., “Payment for Extra Work and Force \nAccount Method.” Adjust the bottom of the shaft or alter the foundation if satisfactory founding material is not \nencountered at plan elevation, as approved, to satisfactorily comply with design requirements. Blasting is not \nallowed for excavations. \nStop drilling if caving conditions are encountered and adopt a construction method that stabilizes the shaft \nwalls. \nDo not excavate a shaft within two shaft diameters (clear) of an open shaft excavation, or one in which \nconcrete has been placed in the preceding 24 hr. \nDispose of material excavated from shafts and not incorporated into the finished project as shown on the \nplans and in conformance with federal, state, and local laws. \nProvide suitable access, lighting, and equipment for proper inspection of the completed excavation and \nchecking of the dimensions and alignment of shaft excavation. \n3.2. Core Holes. Take cores to determine the character of the supporting materials if directed. Use a method that \nwill result in recovery of an intact sample adequate for judging the character of the founding material. Such \ncores should be at least 5 ft. deeper than the proposed founding grade or a depth equal to the diameter of \nthe shaft, whichever is greater. Take these cores when the excavation is complete. \n3.3. Casing. Use casing when necessary to prevent caving of the material, excluding groundwater, when slurry is \nused for hole stabilization, or when required in conformance with the Contractor’s safety plan. Provide casing \nwith an outside diameter not less than the specified diameter of the shaft. The portion of shaft below the \ncasing may be as much as 2 in.    smaller than the specified shaft diameter. No extra compensation will be \nmade for concrete required to fill an oversized casing or oversized excavation. Use casing strong enough to \nwithstand handling stresses and pressures of concrete and of the surrounding earth or water, and that is \nwatertight, smooth, clean, and free of accumulations of hardened concrete. \nUse construction methods that result in a minimal amount of disturbed soil trapped outside the casing. This \ndoes not apply to temporary undersized casings used to protect workers inside shafts or to drilled shafts \ndesigned for point bearing only. \nLeave casing in place only if authorized or shown on the plans. Extract casing only after placing the concrete \nto an appropriate level. Always maintain enough concrete in the casing to counteract soil and water pressure. \nRotate or move the casing up or down a few inches if necessary before and during concrete placement to \nfacilitate extraction of the casing. \n3.4. Requirements for Slurry Displacement Method. When soil conditions warrant, use the slurry displacement \nmethod to construct drilled shafts, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Use this method to support the \nsides of the excavation with processed mineral slurry that is then displaced by concrete to form a continuous \nconcrete shaft. \nInstall surface casing to at least 10 ft. below existing ground before introducing slurry. Do not use casing \nother than surface casing. Do not use surface casing longer than 20 ft. without approval. Do not extract the \nsurface casing until after placing the concrete. \n\n2024 Specifications  416 \n503 \nPre-mix slurry in a reservoir with enough capacity to fill the excavation and for recovery of the slurry during \nconcrete placement. Do not mix slurry in the shaft excavation or other hole. Allow adequate time for \nhydration of the slurry before introduction into the excavation. \nMaintain a head of slurry in the shaft excavation at or near ground level or higher, as necessary, to \ncounteract groundwater pressure during and after drilling. \nUse an air lift or proper size cleanout bucket, just before placing reinforcing steel, to remove any material that \nmay have fallen from the sides of the excavation or accumulated on the bottom after the completion of \ndrilling. Use a cleanout bucket if material is too large to be picked up using an air lift. \nRe-process the hole using the auger as directed if concrete placement is not started within 4 hr. of the \ncompletion of the shaft excavation. Then clean the bottom using an air lift or cleanout bucket and check the \nslurry at the bottom of the hole for compliance with slurry requirements in accordance with Article 416.2., \n“Materials.” \nAgitate the congealed slurry to liquefaction if the slurry forms a gel before concrete placement, and whenever \ndirected. \nRecover and dispose of all slurry as approved, and in conformance with all federal, state, and local laws. Do \nnot discharge slurry into or in close proximity to streams or other bodies of water. \n3.5. Reinforcing Steel. Completely assemble the cage of reinforcing steel and place it as a unit immediately \nbefore concrete placement. The cage consists of longitudinal bars and lateral reinforcement (spiral \nreinforcement, lateral ties, or horizontal bands). Connect individual segments with couplers or by lapping \nsteel as approved if overhead obstacles prevent placement of the cage as a single unit. \nExtend the reinforcing steel cage as follows if the shaft is lengthened beyond plan length, unless directed \notherwise. \n Extend the cage to the bottom for shafts supporting structures other than bridges. \n Extend the cage to 25 ft. or to the bottom, whichever is shorter, for bridge shafts with plan lengths less \nthan 25 ft. \n Do not extend the cage for bridge shafts with plan lengths at least 25 ft. that are lengthened less than \n33% of plan length. \n Extend the cage as directed for bridge shafts with plan lengths at least 25 ft. that are lengthened more \nthan 33% of plan length. \nIf the cage does not reach the bottom of the shaft, it may be suspended, or a portion of the longitudinal steel \nmay be extended to support the cage on the bottom of the shaft. Bars used to extend or support the cage \nmay be lap spliced or welded by a qualified welder. Place the extension at the bottom of the shaft. \nTie spiral reinforcement to the longitudinal bars at a spacing no more than 24 in.   , or as required for a stable \ncage. Ensure lateral reinforcement is not welded to longitudinal bars unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nCenter the reinforcing steel cage in the excavation using approved “roller”-type centering devices unless \notherwise approved. Use concrete or plastic chairs to keep the reinforcing cage off the bottom of the hole. \nUse centering devices starting at 1.5 ft. off from the bottom of the cage and spaced vertically at intervals not \nexceeding 10 ft. Use at least three centering devices per level at a spacing not to exceed 30 in.    Flat or \ncrescent-shaped centralizers (“sleds”) are not allowed. \nSupport or hold down the cage to control vertical displacement during concrete placement or extraction of the \ncasing. Use support that is concentric with the cage to prevent racking and distortion of the steel. \n\n2024 Specifications  416 \n504 \nCheck the elevation of the top of the steel cage before and after concrete placement or after casing \nextraction when casing is used. Downward movement of the steel up to 6 in.    per 20 ft.   of shaft length and \nupward movement of the steel up to 6 in.    total are acceptable. \nMaintain the minimum length of steel required for lap with column steel. Use dowel bars if the proper lap \nlength is provided both into the shaft and into the column. Locate and tie all dowel bars into the cage before \nplacing concrete. \nLocate and tie anchor bolts when required before placement of concrete. Use templates or other devices to \nassure accurate placement of anchor bolts. \n3.6. Concrete. Perform all work in accordance with Item 420, “Concrete Substructures.” Provide concrete with \nmaximum placement temperatures as shown in Table 4. Provide thermal analysis to show, and \ntemperature-recording devices to verify, maximum concrete core temperature requirements are met in \naccordance with Section 420.4.7.14, “Mass Placements,” for shafts with diameter exceeding 7 ft. Instrument \nthe first shaft for each size shaft exceeding 7 ft. diameter, and as directed if results do not meet \nspecifications and when the concrete mix design changes. \n \nTable 4 \nMax Concrete Placing Temperature \nShaft  \nSize  \nMix Design \nOptions 1–5 \nMix Design \nOptions 6–8 \nDiameter <5 ft. 95°F 95°F \n5 ft. ≤ diameter ≤ 7 ft. 95°F 85°F \n7 ft. < diameter 85°F 75°F  \nForm portions of drilled shaft that project above natural ground. \nRemove loose material and accumulated seep water from the bottom of the excavation before placing \nconcrete. No more than 3 in. of water should be present within the base of the excavation at the time of \nconcrete placement. The rate of inflow should be confirmed by observation to be less than 12 in. per hour. \nPlace concrete using underwater placement methods if seepage exceeds the tolerable levels cited above. \nPlace concrete as soon as possible after all excavation is complete and reinforcing steel is placed. Provide \nworkable concrete that does not require vibrating or rodding. Vibrate formed portions of drilled shafts. \nPlace concrete continuously for the entire length of the shaft. Limit free fall of concrete to 25 ft. for dry shafts \nof 24-in.    or smaller diameter. Use a suitable tube or tremie to prevent segregation of materials. Use a tube or \ntremie in sections to provide proper discharge and permit raising as the placement progresses. For dry shafts \nmore than 24-in.    diameter, concrete may be allowed to free fall an unlimited distance if it does not strike the \nreinforcing cage or sides of the hole during placement. Provide a hopper with a minimum 3-ft. long drop-tube \nat the top of the shaft to direct concrete vertically down the center of the shaft when free fall is used. Do not \nuse a shovel or other means to simply deflect the concrete discharge from the truck. \nAlways maintain enough head of concrete for cased shafts above the bottom of the casing to overcome \nhydrostatic pressure. Extract casing at a slow, uniform rate with the pull in line with the axis of the shaft. \nMonitor the concrete level in the casing during extraction. Stop the extraction and add concrete to the casing \nas required to ensure a completely full hole upon casing removal. The elapsed time from the mixing of the \nfirst concrete placed into the cased portion of the shaft until the completion of extraction of the casing must \nnot exceed the time for which the concrete maintains a slump of more than 4 in.    in accordance with \nArticle 416.2., “Materials.” Modify the concrete mix, the construction procedures, or both for subsequent \nshafts if the elapsed time is exceeded. \nCure the top surface and treat any construction joint area in accordance with Item 420. \n3.7. Additional Requirements for Slurry Displacement or Underwater Concrete Placement Methods. Place \nconcrete on the same day the shaft is excavated and as soon as possible after all excavation is complete \n\n2024 Specifications  416 \n505 \nand reinforcing steel is placed. Rework the hole by overdrilling a minimum 1/2 in. on all sides on the same \nday that concrete is placed when drilling of a hole is performed on multiple days if approved. Use an air lift or \ncleanout bucket of the proper size to clean the bottom of the excavation before placing the reinforcing steel \ncage and concrete. Place concrete through a closed tremie or pump it to the bottom of the excavation. The \nminimum tremie diameter will be at least six times the maximum size of aggregate used in the concrete mix, \nbut not less than 10 in.    Initially seal the tremie or pump line to positively separate the concrete from the slurry \nor water. Place concrete continuously from the beginning of placement until the shaft is completed. Always \nkeep the tremie full of concrete and well submerged in the previously placed concrete if using a tremie. Raise \nthe tremie as necessary to maintain the free flow of concrete and the stability of any casing used. Always \nkeep the discharge tube submerged in the previously placed concrete if using a pump. Place additional \nconcrete to ensure the removal of any contaminated concrete at the top of the shaft. Allow the top portion of \nconcrete to flush completely from the hole at the completion of the pour until there is no evidence of slurry or \nwater contamination. Do not attempt to remove this concrete using shovels, pumps, or other means. Level \nthe top of shaft with hand tools as necessary. \nUse a sump or other approved method to channel displaced fluid and concrete away from the shaft \nexcavation. Recover slurry and dispose of it as approved. Do not discharge displaced fluids into or near \nstreams or other bodies of water. Provide a collar or other means of capturing slurry and the top portion of \nconcrete flushed from the shaft for pours over water. \nRemove the tube, reseal it at the bottom, penetrate with the tube into the concrete already placed by at least \n5   ft., and recharge it before continuing if concrete placement is interrupted due to withdrawal of the \nsubmerged end of the tremie or pump discharge tube before completion. If this condition exists, notify the \nEngineer and note the elevation and circumstances related to the loss of seal on the drilled shaft log. \nThe elapsed time from the mixing of the first concrete placed until the completion of concrete placement, \nincluding extraction of the casing, must not exceed the time for which the concrete maintains a slump of \nmore than 4 in.    in accordance with Article 416.2., “Materials.” Modify the concrete mix, the construction \nprocedures, or both for subsequent shafts if the elapsed time is exceeded. \n3.8. Test Load. Load test shafts, if required, in accordance with Item 405, “Foundation Load Test.” \n3.9. Trial Shaft. When required on the plans, construct trial shafts to the depth and diameter shown on the plans. \nTrial shafts include drilling the hole, placement of the rebar cage (unless otherwise stated), and placement of \nthe concrete. When trial shafts are required, delay start of production shafts until successful completion of \ntrial shafts. \n4. MEASUREMENT \n4.1. Drilled Shaft. Drilled shaft foundations will be measured by the foot to the bottom of the shaft. \n4.1.1. Interior Bents and Piers. Shafts will be measured from a point approximately 6 in.  below the finished \nearthwork elevation at the center of each shaft, unless specific elevations or dimensions are shown on the \nplans or unless otherwise directed to meet unusual conditions. The bent height shown on the plans is for \nestimating purposes only and does not control the top-of-shaft measurement. \n4.1.2. Abutment Bents and Retaining Walls. Shafts will be measured from the bottom of footing or cap elevation. \n4.1.3. Other Non-Bridge Structures. Shafts, including trial shafts, will be measured from the top of the shaft. \n4.2.

Make enough test specimens for Contractor-performed testing to \nensure strength requirements are met for the operations listed in Section 420.4.1., “Schedule Restrictions.” \nMake at least one set of test specimens for each element cast each day. Cure these specimens under the \nsame conditions as the portion of the structure involved for all stages of construction. Ensure safe handling, \ncuring, and storage of all test specimens. Provide testing personnel, and sample and test the hardened \nconcrete in accordance with Section 421.4.8., “Sampling and Testing of Concrete.” The maturity method, \nTex-426-A\n, may be used for in-situ strength determination for schedule restrictions if approved. Coring will \nnot be allowed for in-situ strength determination for schedule restrictions. Provide the Engineer the \nopportunity to witness all testing operations. Report all test results to the Engineer. \nIf the Contractor does not wish to perform schedule restriction testing, the Engineer’s 7-day lab-cured tests, \nperformed in accordance with Article 421.5., “Acceptance of Concrete,” will be used for schedule restriction \ndeterminations. The Engineer may require additional time for strength gain to account for field curing \nconditions such as cold weather. \n4.1. Schedule Restrictions. Construct and open completed structures to traffic with the following limitations \nunless otherwise shown on the plans. \n4.1.1. Setting Forms. Attain at least 2,500 psi compressive strength before erecting forms on concrete footings \nsupported by piling or drilled shafts, or on individual drilled shafts.

Do not allow offsets at form joints to \nexceed 1/16 in.    \nUse only material that is inert, non-biodegradable, and nonabsorptive for forms to be left in place. \nConstruct all forms to permit their removal without marring or damaging the concrete. Clean all forms and \nfooting areas of any extraneous matter before placing concrete. Provide openings in forms if needed for the \nremoval of laitance or foreign matter. \nTreat the facing of all forms with bond-breaking coating of composition that will not discolor or injuriously \naffect the concrete surface. Take care to prevent coating of the reinforcing steel. \nComplete all preparatory work before requesting permission to place concrete. \nCease placement if the forms show signs of bulging or sagging at any stage of the placement, and remove \nthe portion of the concrete causing this condition immediately as directed. Reset the forms and securely \nbrace them against further movement before continuing the placement. \n4.4.2. Timber Forms. Provide properly seasoned, good-quality lumber that is free of imperfections that would \naffect its strength or impair the finished surface of the concrete. Provide timber or lumber that meets or \nexceeds the requirements for species and grade shown on the submitted formwork plans. \nMaintain forms or form lumber that will be reused so it stays clean and in good condition. Do not use any \nlumber that is split, warped, bulged, or marred, or that has defects in any way that will produce inferior work. \nPromptly remove such lumber from the work. \nProvide form lining for all formed surfaces except: \n the inside of culvert barrels, inlets, manholes, and box girders; \n surfaces that are subsequently covered by backfill material or are completely enclosed; and \n any surface formed by a single finished board or by plywood. \nProvide form lining of an approved type such as masonite or plywood. Do not provide thin membrane \nsheeting such as polyethylene sheets for form lining. \nUse plywood at least 3/4 in.    thick. Place the grain of the face plies on plywood forms parallel to the span \nbetween the supporting studs or joists unless otherwise shown on the submitted form drawings. \nUse plywood for forming surfaces that remain exposed that meets the requirements for B-B Plyform Class I \nor Class II Exterior of the U.S. Department of Commerce Voluntary Product Standard PS 1. \nSpace studs and joists so the facing form material remains in true alignment under the imposed loads. \nSpace wales closely enough to hold forms securely to the designated lines, scabbed at least 4 ft. on each \nside of joints to provide continuity. Place a row of wales near the bottom of each placement. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n515 \nPlace facing material with parallel and square joints, securely fastened to supporting studs. \nPlace forms with the form panels symmetrical (long dimensions set in the same direction) for surfaces \nexposed to view and receiving only an ordinary surface finish in accordance with Section 420.4.13., \n“Ordinary Surface Finish.” Make horizontal joints continuous. \nMake molding for chamfer strips or other uses of materials of a grade that will not split when nailed and can \nbe maintained to a true line without warping.

Placing Concrete. Give the Engineer sufficient advance notice before placing concrete in any unit of the \nstructure to permit the inspection of forms, reinforcing steel placement, and other preparations. \nDo not place concrete when impending weather conditions would impair the quality of the finished work. \nPlace concrete in early morning or at night or adjust the placement schedule for more favorable weather \nwhen conditions of wind, humidity, and temperature are such that concrete cannot be placed without the \npotential for weather-related distress. \nAdequately illuminate the entire placement site as approved when mixing, placing, and finishing concrete in \nnon-daylight hours. \nFurnish adequate shelter to protect the concrete against damage from rainfall or freezing temperatures in \naccordance with this Item if changes in weather conditions require protective measures after work starts. \nContinue operations during rainfall only if approved. Use protective coverings for the material stockpiles. \nCover aggregate stockpiles only to the extent necessary to control the moisture conditions in the aggregates. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n516 \nAllow at least 1 curing day after the concrete has achieved initial set before placing strain on projecting \nreinforcement to prevent damage to the concrete. \n4.7.1. Placing Temperature. Place concrete in accordance with the following temperature limits for the classes of \nconcrete defined in Section 421.4.1., “Classification of Concrete Mix Designs.” \n Place Class C, F, H, K, or SS concrete only when its temperature at time of placement is between 50°F \nand 95°F. Increase the minimum placement temperature to 60°F if slag cement is used in the concrete. \n Place Class S concrete, used in this Item only as indicated for culvert top slabs, only when its \ntemperature is between 50°F and 85°F. Increase the minimum placement temperature to 60°F if slag \ncement is used in the concrete. \n Place Class A, B, and D concrete only when its temperature at the time of placement is greater than \n50°F. \n Place mass concrete in accordance with Section 420.4.7.14., “Mass Placements,” only when its \ntemperature at the time of placement is between 50°F and 75°F. \n4.7.2. Transporting Time. Begin the discharge of concrete delivered in truck mixers within the times shown in \nTable 14 of Item 421. \n4.7.3. Workability of Concrete. Place concrete with a slump as specified in Section 421.4.2.5., “Slump.” Water \nmay be added to the concrete before discharging any concrete from the truck to adjust for low slump, \nprovided that the maximum mix design water-cement ratio is not exceeded. Mix concrete in accordance with \nSection 421.4.6., “Mixing and Delivering Concrete,” after introduction of any additional water or chemical \nadmixtures. Do not add water or chemical admixtures after any concrete has been discharged. \n4.7.4. Transporting Concrete. Transport concrete by buckets, chutes, buggies, belt conveyors, pumps, or other \nmethods. \nProtect concrete transported by conveyors from sun and wind to prevent loss of slump and workability. \nS\nhade or wrap with wet burlap pipes through which concrete is pumped as necessary to prevent loss of \nslump and workability. \nArrange and use chutes, troughs, conveyors, or pipes so the concrete ingredients will not be separated. \nT\nerminate such equipment in vertical downspouts when necessary to prevent segregation. Extend open \ntroughs and chutes, if necessary, down inside the forms or through holes left in the forms. \nKeep all transporting equipment clean and free of har\ndened concrete coatings. Discharge water used for \ncleaning clear of the concrete. \n4.7.5. P\nreparation of Surfaces. Thoroughly wet all forms and hardened concrete on which concrete is to be \nplaced before placing concrete on them. Remove any remaining puddles of excess water before placing \nconcrete. Provide surfaces that are in a moist, saturated surface-dry (SSD) condition when concrete is \nplaced on them. \nEnsure the subgrade or foundation is moist before placing concrete on grade. Lightly sprinkle the subgrade if \ndry. \n4.7.6. E\nxpansion Joints. Construct joints and devices to provide for expansion and contraction as shown on the \nplans. \nUse light wire or nails to anchor any preformed fiber joint material to the concrete on one side of the joint. \nEnsure finished joints conform to the plans with the concrete sections completely separated by the specified \nopening or joint material. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n517 \nRemove all concrete within the joint opening soon after form removal and again where necessary after \nsurface finishing to ensure full effectiveness of the joint. \n4.7.7. C\nonstruction Joints. A construction joint is the joint formed by placing plastic concrete in direct contact with \nconcrete that has attained its initial set. Monolithic placement means the manner and sequence of concrete \nplacing do not create a construction joint. \nMake construction joints of the type and at the locations shown on the plans. Additional joints in other \nm\nembers are not permitted without approval. Place authorized additional joints using details equivalent to \nthose shown on the plans for joints in similar locations. \nMake construction joints square and normal to the forms unless otherwise required. Use bulkheads in the \nforms for all vertical joints. \nThoroughly roughen the top surface of a concrete placement terminating at a horizontal\n construction joint as \nsoon as practical after initial set is attained. \nThoroughly clean the hardened concrete surface of all loose material, laitance, dirt, and foreign matter, and \ns\naturate it with water. Remove all free water and moisten the surface before concrete or bonding grout is \nplaced against it. Ensure the surface of the existing concrete is in an SSD condition just before placing \nsubsequent concrete. Wet the existing concrete by ponding water on the surface for 24 hr. before placing \nsubsequent concrete. Use high-pressure water blasting if ponding is not possible to achieve SSD conditions \n15–30 min. before placing the concrete. An SSD condition is achieved when the surface remains damp when \nexposed to sunlight for 15 min. \nDraw forms tight against the existing concrete to avoid mortar loss and offsets at joints. \nBonding agents are not required unless indicated otherwise. Coat the joint surface with bonding mortar, \ngrout, epoxy, or other material if a bonding agent is required as shown on the plans. Provide Type V epoxy in \naccordance with DMS-6100\n for bonding fresh concrete to hardened concrete. Place the bonding epoxy on a \nclean, dry surface, and place the fresh concrete while the epoxy is still tacky. Place bonding mortar or grout \non a surface that is SSD and place the concrete before the bonding mortar or grout dries. Place other \nbonding agents in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. \n4.7.8. H\nandling and Placing. Minimize segregation of the concrete and displacement of the reinforcement when \nhandling and placing concrete. Produce a uniform, dense compact mass. \nEnsure concrete free f\nalls no more than 5 ft. except in the case of drilled shafts, thin walls such as in culverts, \nor as allowed in conformance with other Items. Remove any hardened concrete splatter ahead of the plastic \nconcrete. \nFill each part of the forms by depositing concrete as near to i\nts final position as possible. Do not deposit large \nquantities of concrete at one point and run or move the concrete along to fill the forms. \nDeposit concrete in the forms in layers of suitable depth but no more than 36 in\n. deep unless otherwise \npermitted. \nAvoid cold joints in a monolithic placement. Sequence successive layers or adjacent portions of concrete so \nt\nhey can be vibrated into a homogeneous mass with the previously placed concrete before it sets. Allow no \nmore than 1 hr. to elapse between adjacent or successive placements of concrete when re-vibration of the \nconcrete is shown on the plans,  except as otherwise allowed by an approved placing procedure. This time \nlimit may be extended by 1/2 hr. if the concrete contains at least the minimum recommended dosage of a \nType B or Type D admixture. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n518 \n4.7.9. Consolidation. Carefully consolidate concrete and flush mortar to the form surfaces using immersion-type \nvibrators. Do not use vibrators that operate by attachment to forms or reinforcement except where approved \non steel forms. \nVibrate the concrete immediately after deposit. Systematically space points of vibration to ensure complete \nc\nonsolidation and thorough working of the concrete around the reinforcement and embedded fixtures, and \ninto the corners and angles of the forms. Insert the vibrators vertically where possible. Vibrate the entire \ndepth of each lift, allowing the vibrator to penetrate several inches into the preceding lift. Do not use the \nvibrator to move the concrete to other locations in the forms. Do not drag the vibrator through the concrete. \nThoroughly consolidate concrete along construction joints by operating the vibrator along and close to but not \nagainst the joint surface. Continue the vibration until the concrete surrounding reinforcements and fixtures is \ncompletely consolidated. Hand-spade or rod the concrete if necessary to ensure flushing of mortar to the \nsurface of all forms. \n4.7.10. Installation of Dowels and Anchor Bolts. When shown on the plans, provide an Adhesive Anchor Installer \ncertified by ACI. Install dowels and anchor bolts by casting them in place or by grouting with grout, epoxy, or \nepoxy mortar unless specified otherwise. Form or drill holes for grouting. Follow the manufacturer’s \nrecommended installation procedures for pre-packaged grout or epoxy anchor systems. Test anchors if \nrequired on the plans or in conformance with other Items.  \nDrill holes for anchor bolts to accommodate the bolt embedment required by t\nhe plans. Make holes for \ndowels at least 12 in.    deep unless otherwise shown on the plans. Make the hole diameter at least twice the \ndowel or bolt diameter, but not exceeding the dowel or bolt diameter plus 1-1/2 in.    when using cementitious \ngrout or epoxy mortar. Make the hole diameter 1/16–1/4 in.    greater than the dowel or bolt diameter when \nusing neat epoxy unless specified otherwise by the epoxy manufacturer. \nThoroughly clean holes of all loose material, oil, grease, or other bond-br\neaking substance, and blow them \nclean with filtered compressed air. Use a wire brush followed by oil-free compressed air to remove all loose \nmaterial from the holes, repeating as necessary until no more material is removed. Ensure holes are in a \nsurface-dry condition when epoxy-type materials are used and in a surface-moist condition when \ncementitious grout is used. Develop and demonstrate for approval a procedure for cleaning and preparing \nthe holes for installation of the dowels and anchor bolts. Completely fill the void between the hole and dowel \nor bolt with grouting material. Follow exactly the requirements for cleaning in conformance with the product \nspecifications for pre-packaged systems. \nProvide hydraulic cement grout for cast-in-place or grouted systems in accordance with DMS-4675. Provide \na Type III epoxy in accordance with DMS-6100 when neat epoxy is used for anchor bolts or dowels. Provide \nType VIII epoxy in accordance with DMS-6100 when an epoxy grout is used. Provide grout, epoxy, or epoxy \nmortar as the binding agent unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nProvide other anchor systems as required on the plans. \n4.7.11. P\nlacing Concrete in Cold Weather. Protect concrete placed under weather conditions where weather may \nadversely affect results. Permission given by the Engineer for placing during cold weather does not relieve \nthe Contractor of responsibility for producing concrete equal in quality to that placed under normal conditions. \nRemove and replace concrete as directed at the Contractor’s expense if it is determined unsatisfactory due \nto poor conditions. \nDo not place concrete in contact wi\nth any material coated with frost or with a temperature of 32°F or lower. \nDo not place concrete when the ambient temperature in the shade is below 40°F and falling unless \napproved. Place concrete when the ambient temperature in the shade is at least 35°F and rising or above \n40°F. \nProvide and install recording thermometers, maturity meters, or other suitable temperature-measuring \ndevices to verify all concrete is effectively protected as follows. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n519 \n Maintain the temperature at all surfaces of concrete in bents, piers, culvert walls, retaining walls, \nparapets, wingwalls, top slabs of non-direct traffic culverts, and other similar formed concrete at or \nabove 40°F for 72 hr. from the time of placement. \n Maintain the temperature of all other concrete, including the bottom slabs (footings) of culverts, placed \non or in the ground above 32°F for 72 hr. from the time of placement. \nUse additional covering, insulated forms, or other means and, if necessary, supplement the covering with \nartificial heating. Avoid applying heat directly to concrete surfaces. Cure in accordance with \nSection 420.4.10., “Curing Concrete,” during this period until all requirements for curing have been satisfied. \nHave all necessary heating and covering material ready for use before permission is granted to begin \nplacement when impending weather conditions indicate the possible need for temperature protection. \n4.7.12. Placing Concrete in Hot Weather. Keep the concrete at or below the maximum temperature at time of \nplacement in accordance with Section 420.4.7.1., “Placing Temperature.” Sprinkle and shade aggregate \nstockpiles or use ice, liquid nitrogen systems, or other approved methods as necessary to control the \nconcrete temperature. \n4.7.13. Placing Concrete in Water. Deposit concrete in water only when shown on the plans or with approval. Make \nforms or cofferdams tight enough to prevent any water current passing through the space in which the \nconcrete is being deposited. Do not pump water during the concrete placing or until the concrete has set for \nat least 36 hr. \nPlace the concrete using a tremie or pump, or use another approved method, and do not allow it to fall freely \nthrough the water or disturb it after it is placed. Keep the concrete surface level during placement. \nSupport the tremie or operate t\nhe pump so it can be easily moved horizontally to cover all the work area and \nvertically to control the concrete flow. Keep the lower end of the tremie or pump hose submerged in the \nconcrete. Use continuous placing operations until the work is complete. \nDesign the concrete mix in accordance with Item 421 w\nith a minimum cement content of 650 lb. per cubic \nyard for concrete to be placed under water. Include an anti-washout admixture in the mix design as \nnecessary to produce a satisfactory finished product. \n4.7.14. Mass Placements. Develop and obtain approval for a heat control plan for monolithic placements \ndesignated on the plans as mass concrete to ensure the following during the heat dissipation period: \n the temperature differential between the central core of the placement and the exposed concrete \nsurface does not exceed 35°F and \n the temperature at the central core of the placement does not exceed 160°F. \nUse the ConcreteWorks© software available from the Department, or another approved method in \naccordance with ACI 207, “Mass Concrete,” to develop the heat control plan. The Department will make \navailable technical assistance on the use of ConcreteWorks©. Develop the heat control plan using historical \ntemperature ranges for the anticipated time of the mass placement. Re-create the plan if the work schedule \nshifts by more than one month. \nThe heat control plan may include a combination of the following elements: \n selection of concrete ingredients including aggregates, gradation, and cement types, to minimize heat of \nhydration; \n use of ice or other concrete cooling ingredients; \n use of liquid nitrogen dosing systems; \n controlling rate or time of concrete placement; \n use of insulation or supplemental external heat to control heat loss; \n use of supplementary cementing materials; \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n520 \n use of a cooling system to control the core temperature; or \n vary the duration for which formwork remains in place. \nFurnish and install two pairs of temperature-recording devices, maturity meters, or other approved equivalent \ndevices. Install devices to measure the surface temperature no more than 3 in.    from the surface. Install \ndevices to measure the core temperature half the least dimension from the nearest surface near the point of \nmaximum predicted heat. Use these devices to simultaneously measure the temperature of the concrete at \nthe core and the surface. Maintain temperature control methods for 4 days unless otherwise approved in \nconformance with the submitted heat control plan. Do not use maturity meters to predict strength of mass \nconcrete. Revise the heat control plan as necessary to maintain the temperature limitations shown above. \nIf the core temperature exceeds 160°F, the mass concrete element will be subject to review and acceptance \nby\n the Engineer using forensic analyses to determine its potential reduction in service life or performance. \nProceed with subsequent construction on the affected element only when notified regarding acceptance. \nRepair any resulting cracking if the temperature differential between the central core of the placement and \nthe nearest concrete surface exceeds 35°F at no expense to the Department and revise the heat control plan \nas necessary to prevent further occurrences. \n4.7.15. P\nlacing Concrete in Foundation and Substructure. Do not place concrete in footings until the depth and \ncharacter of the foundation have been inspected and permission has been given to proceed. \nPlace concrete footings upon seal concrete after the cofferdams are free of w\nater and the seal concrete is \ncleaned. Perform any necessary pumping or bailing during the concreting from a suitable sump located \noutside the forms. \nConstruct or adjust all temporary wales or braces inside cofferdams as the work proceeds to prevent \nunauthorized construction joints. \nOmit forms when footings can be placed in a dry excavation without the use of cofferdams, if approved, and \nfill the entire excavation with concrete to the elevation of the top of footing. \nPlace concrete in columns monolithically between construction joints unless otherwise directed. Columns \nand c\naps or tie beams supported on them may be placed in the same operation or separately. Allow for \nsettlement and shrinkage of the column concrete, if placed in the same operation, by placing it to the lower \nlevel of the cap or tie beam, and delay placement between 1 hr. and 2 hr. before proceeding with the cap or \ntie beam placement. \n4.7.16. P\nlacing Concrete in Box Culverts. Allow between 1 hr. and 2 hr. to elapse where the top slab and walls are \nplaced monolithically in culverts more than 4 ft. in clear height before placing the top slab to allow for \nsettlement and shrinkage in the wall concrete. \nAccurately finish the footing slab at the proper time to provide a smooth, uni\nform surface. Finish top slabs \nthat carry direct traffic in accordance with Item 422, “Concrete Superstructures.” Give top slabs of fill-type \nculverts a float finish. \n4.8. Extending Existing Substructures.  Verify pertinent dimensions and elevations of the existing structure \nbefore ordering any required materials. \n4.8.1. Removal. Remove portions of the existing structure to the lines and dimensions shown on the plans or as \ndirected. Dispose of these materials as shown on the plans or as directed. Repair any portion of the \nremaining structure damaged by the construction. \nDo not use explosives to remove portions of the existing structure unless approved in writing. Do not use a \ndemolition ball, other swinging weight, or impact equipment unless shown on the plans. Use pneumatic or \nhydraulic tools for final removal of concrete at the “break” line. Use removal equipment, as approved, that will \nnot damage the remaining concrete. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n521 \n4.8.2. Reuse of Removed Portions of Structure. Detach and remove all portions of the old structure that are to \nbe incorporated into the extended structure to the lines and details as shown on the plans or as directed. \nMove the unit to be reused to the new location specified using approved methods. Place the reinforcement \nand extension concrete as shown on the plans. \n4.8.3. Splicing Reinforcing Steel. Splice new reinforcing bars to exposed bars in the existing structure using lap \nsplices in accordance with Item 440, unless otherwise shown on the plans. The new reinforcing steel does \nnot need to be tied to the existing steel where spacing or elevation does not match that of the existing steel, \nprovided the lap length is attained. Weld in accordance with Item 448 when welded splices are permitted. \nInstall any required dowels in accordance with Section 420.4.7.10., “Installation of Dowels and Anchor Bolts.” \n4.8.4. Concrete Preparation. Roughen and clean concrete surfaces that are in contact with new construction \nbefore placing forms. Prepare these construction joint surfaces in accordance with Section 420.4.7.7., \n“Construction Joints.” \n4.9. Treatment and Finishing of Horizontal Surfaces. Strike off to grade and finish all unformed upper \nsurfaces. Do not use mortar topping for surfaces constructed under this Section. \nFloat the surface with a suitable float after the concrete has been struck off. \nSlope the tops of caps and piers between bearing areas from the center slightly toward the edge, and slope \nthe tops of abutment and transition bent caps from the backwall to the edge, as directed, so water drains \nfrom the surface. Give the concrete a smooth trowel finish. Construct bearing areas for steel units in \naccordance with Section 441.3.11.6., “Bearing and Anchorage Devices.” Give the bearing area under the \nexpansion ends of concrete slabs and slab and girder spans a steel-trowel finish to the exact grades \nrequired. Give bearing areas under elastomeric bearing pads or nonreinforced bearing seat buildups a \ntextured, wood float finish. Do not allow the bearing area to vary from a level plane more than 1/16 in.    in all \ndirections. \nCast bearing seat buildups or pedestals for concrete units integrally with the cap or a construction joint. \nProvide a latex-based mortar, an epoxy mortar, or an approved proprietary bearing mortar for bearing seat \nbuildups cast with a construction joint. Mix mortars in conformance with the manufacturer’s \nrecommendations. Construct pedestals of Class C concrete, reinforced as shown on the plans or as \nindicated in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The Engineer of Record will design pedestals higher than 12 in.    \n \nFigure 1 \nSection Through Bearing Seat Buildups \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n522 \n \nFigure 2 \nPlan View of Bearing Seat Buildups \n4.10. Curing Concrete. Obtain approval of the proposed curing methods, equipment, and materials before placing \nconcrete. The Engineer may require the same curing methods for like portions of a single structure. \nInadequate curing or facilities may delay all concrete placements on the project until remedial action is taken. \nA curing day is a calendar day when the temperature, taken in the shade away from artificial heat, is above \n50°F for at least 19 hr. or, on colder days if the temperature of all surfaces of the concrete is maintained \nabove 40°F, for the entire 24 hr. The required curing period begins when all concrete has attained its initial \nset unless specified otherwise. Tex-440-A\n m\nay be used to determine when the concrete has attained its \ninitial set. \nCure all concrete for 4 c\nonsecutive days except as allowed for the curing options listed below. Use form or \nmembrane curing for vertical surfaces unless otherwise approved. Use only water curing for horizontal \nsurfaces of high-performance concrete (HPC)  or mass concrete. Use water or membrane curing for \nhorizontal or unformed surfaces for all other concrete. \nUse one of the following curing options for vertical surfaces, unless specified otherwise. \n Form cure for 48 hr. after placement. \n Form cure for 12 hr. after placement followed by membrane curing. \n For HPC, form cure for 48 hr. after placement followed by membrane curing. \n For mass concrete, form cure in conformance with the heat control plan followed by membrane curing if \nforms are removed before 4 days. \nApply membrane curing, if used, within 2 hr. of form removal. \nUse only water curing in accordance with this Section for the top surface of any concrete unit upon which \nconcrete is to be placed and bonded at a later interval (e.g., stub walls, caps with backwalls, and risers). \nCure all other concrete in conformance with the pertinent Items. Use the following methods for curing \nconcrete in accordance with this Item. \n4.10.1. Form Curing. When forms are left in intimate contact with the concrete, other curing methods are not \nrequired except for exposed surfaces and for cold weather protection. Use another approved curing method \nif forms are removed before the 4-day required curing period. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n523 \n4.10.2. Water Curing. Keep all exposed surfaces of the concrete wet continuously for the required curing time. Use \nwater curing in accordance with concrete mixing water in Section 421.2.5., “Water.” Do not use seawater or \nwater that stains or leaves an unsightly residue. \n4.10.2.1. Blankets. Keep the concrete continuously wet by maintaining wet cotton or burlap mats in direct contact with \nthe concrete for the required curing time. Weight the mats adequately to provide continuous contact with all \nconcrete. Cover surfaces that cannot be cured by direct contact with mats, forming an enclosure well \nanchored to the forms or ground so outside air cannot enter the enclosure. Provide sufficient moisture inside \nthe enclosure to keep all surfaces of the concrete wet. \n4.10.2.2. Water Spray. Overlap sprays or sprinklers to keep all unformed surfaces continuously wet. \n4.10.2.3. Ponding. Cover the surfaces with at least 2 in.    of clean granular material, always kept wet, or at least 1 in.    of \ndeep water. Use a dam to retain the water or saturated granular material. \n4.10.3. Membrane Curing. Choose either Type 1-D or Type 2 membrane-curing compound unless otherwise shown \non the plans. Use the same type of curing compound on an individual member. \nApply membrane curing just after free moisture has disappeared at a rate of approximately 180 sq\n. ft. per \ngallon. Do not spray curing compound on projecting reinforcing steel or concrete that will later form a \nconstruction joint. Do not apply membrane curing to dry surfaces. Dampen formed surfaces and surfaces \nthat have been given a first rub, so they are moist at the time of application of the membrane. \nLeave the film unbroken for the minimum curing period specified when membrane is used for complete \nc\nuring. Correct damaged membrane immediately by reapplication of membrane. Polyethylene sheeting, \nburlap-polyethylene mats, or laminated mats in close contact with the concrete surfaces are equivalent to \nmembrane curing. \n4.11. Removal of Forms and Falsework. Remove forms for vertical surfaces after the concrete has aged at least \n12 hr. after initial set,  provided the removal can be done without damage to the concrete, unless otherwise \ndirected. Keep forms for mass placements in place for 4 days following concrete placement unless otherwise \napproved based on the outcome of the heat control plan in accordance with Section 420.4.7.14., “Mass \nPlacements.” \nLeave in place weight-supporting forms and falsework spanning more than 1 ft. for all bridge components \nand culvert slabs except as directed otherwise until the concrete has attained a compressive strength of \n2,500 psi. Remove forms for other structural components as necessary. \nRemove inside forms (walls and top slabs) for box culverts and sewers after concrete has attained a \ncompressive strength of 1,800 psi if an approved overhead support system is used to transfer the weight of \nthe top slab to the walls of the box culvert or sewer before removal of the support provided by the forms. \nForms or parts of forms may be removed only if constructed to permit removal without disturbing forms or \nfalsework required to be left in place for a longer period on other portions of the structure. \nRemove all metal appliances used inside forms for alignment to a depth of at least 1/2 in.    from the concrete \nsurface. Make the appliances so metal may be removed without undue chipping or spalling of the concrete, \nand so it leaves a smooth opening in the concrete surface when removed. Do not burn off rods, bolts, or ties. \nRemove all forms and falsework unless otherwise directed. \n4.12. Defective Work. Repair defective work as soon as possible. Remove and replace at the expense of the \nContractor any defect that cannot be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. \n\n2024 Specifications  420 \n524 \n4.13. Ordinary Surface Finish. Apply an ordinary surface finish to all concrete surfaces. Provide surfaces with \nuniform appearance. Address defects and surface irregularities not consistent with the intent of the expected \nfinish by the following: \n Chip away all loose or broken material to sound concrete where porous, spalled, or honeycombed areas \nare visible after form removal. \n Repair spalls in accordance with the Concrete Repair Manual available on the Department’s website. \n Clean and fill holes or spalls caused by the removal of metal appliances used inside forms, with latex \ngrout, cement grout, or epoxy grout as approved. Do not blend the patch with the surrounding concrete. \n Remove all fins, rust staining, runs, drips, or mortar from surfaces that will be exposed. Smooth all form \nmarks and chamfer edges by grinding or dry-rubbing. \n Ensure all repairs are dense, well-bonded, and properly cured. Finish exposed large repairs to blend \nwith the surrounding concrete where a higher class of finish is not specified. \nApply an ordinary surface finish as the final finish to the following exposed surfaces unless specified \notherwise: \n inside and top of inlets, \n inside and top of manholes, \n inside of sewer appurtenances, and \n inside of culvert barrels. \nForm marks and chamfer edges do not need to be smoothed for the inside of culvert barrels. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nThis Item will be measured by the cubic yard, square yard, foot, square foot, or each structure. \n5.1. General.  Concrete quantities will be based on the dimensions shown on the plans or those established in \nwriting by the Engineer. \nIn determining quantities, no deductions will be made for chamfers less than 2 in.    or for embedded portions \nof steel or prestressed concrete beams, piling, anchor bolts, reinforcing steel, drains, weep holes, junction \nboxes, electrical or telephone conduit, ducts and voids for prestressed tendons, or embedded portions of \nlight fixtures. \nVariation in concrete headwall quantity incurred when an alternate bid for pipe is permitted will not be cause \nfor payment adjustment. \nQuantities revised by a change in design, measured as specified, will be increased or decreased and \nincluded for payment. \n5.2.

If not provided this option, the Engineer may require additional trial batches, including \ntesting, before the concrete is placed. \nTrial batches for precast concrete will be performed in accordance with Tex-703-I to show proposed mix \ndesign meets the requirements of the pertinent class of concrete, or Table 11 when SCC is used.  \nEstablish a compressive strength target value in accordance with Tex-427-A for each Class A, B, and E \nconcrete. \nWhen changes are made to the type, brand, or source of aggregates, cement, SCM, w\nater, or chemical \nadmixtures, submit previous satisfactory field data, data from a new trial batch, or other evidence showing \nthe change will not adversely affect the relevant properties of the concrete. Submit the data for approval \nbefore making changes to the mix design. A change in vendor does not necessarily constitute a change in \nmaterials or source. The Engineer may waive new trial batches when there is a prior record of satisfactory \nperformance with the ingredients. During concrete production, dosage changes of chemical admixtures used \nin the trial batches will not require a re-evaluation of the mix design. \nThe Contractor has the opt\nion of performing trial batches in conjunction with concrete placements except for \nSCC mixtures, when new trial batches are required during the course of the project. If the concrete fails to \nmeet any requirement, the Engineer will determine acceptability and payment adjustments. Establishing \ntarget strength for Class A, B, and E concrete may be conducted during these placements. \nEstablish the strength–maturity relationship in accordance with Tex-426-A when the maturity method is \nspecified or permitted. When using the maturity method, any changes in any of the ingredients, including \nchanges in proportions, will require the development of a new strength–maturity relationship for the mix. \n4.3.1. Mix Design of Record. Once a trial batch or previously satisfactory field data substantiates the mix design, \nthe proportions and mixing methods used become the mix design of record. Do not exceed mix design \nw/cm ratio. \n\n2024 Specifications  421 \n538 \n4.4. Production Testing. \n4.4.1. Aggregate Moisture Testing. Determine moisture content in accordance with Tex-409-A or Tex-425-A\n for \ncoarse, intermediate, and fine aggregates at least twice per week, when there is an apparent change, or for \nnew shipments of aggregate. When aggregate hoppers or storage bins are equipped with properly \nmaintained electronic moisture probes for continuous moisture determination, moisture tests in accordance \nwith \nTex-409-A or Tex-425-A are not required.  \nWhen producing SCC, and when aggregate hoppers or storage bins are not equipped with electronic \nmoisture probes, determine the moisture content of the aggregates before producing the first concrete batch \neach day. Thereafter, determine the moisture content every 4 hr. or when there is an apparent change while \nSCC is being produced. \n4.4.2. Aggregate Gradation Testing. Perform a sieve analysis in accordance with Tex-401-A\n on each stockpile \nused in the blend at least 1 day before producing OAG concrete. Perform sieve analysis on each stockpile \nafter every 10,000 cu. yd. of Class P OAG concrete produced, and every 1,000 cu. yd. for all other \nstructural-class concrete. Provide sieve analysis data to the Engineer. \n4.5. Measurement of Materials. \n4.5.1. Non-Volumetric Mixers. Measure aggregates by weight. Correct batch weight measurements for aggregate \nmoisture content. Measure mixing water, consisting of water added to the batch, ice added to the batch, \nwater occurring as surface moisture on the aggregates, and water introduced in the form of admixtures, by \nvolume or weight. Measure ice by weight. Measure cement and SCMs in a hopper and on a separate scale \nfrom those used for other materials. When measuring by cumulative weight, measure the cement first and \nensure the cement meets the cement tolerance shown in Table 12 before measuring the SCMs.  Measure \nconcrete chemical admixtures by weight or volume. Measure batch materials within the tolerances shown in \nTable 12. \nTable 12 \nMix Design Batching Tolerances—Non-Volumetric Mixers\n \nMaterial Tolerance (%) \nCement, wt.  ˗1 to +3 \nSCM, wt.  ˗1 to +3 \nCement + SCM (cumulative weighing), wt.  ˗1 to +3 \nWater, wt. or volume ±3\n1\n \nFine aggregate, wt.  ±2 \nCoarse aggregate, wt.  ±2 \nFine + coarse aggregate (cumulative weighing), wt.  ±1 \nChemical admixtures, wt. or volume ±3 \n1. Allowable deviation from target weight, not including water withheld or moisture in the \naggregate. The Engineer will verify the w/cm ratio is within specified limits. \nEnsure the quantity measured, when measuring cementitious materials at less than 30% of scale capacity, is \naccurate to no less than the required amount and no more than 4% in excess. Ensure the cumulative \nquantity, when measuring aggregates in a cumulative weigh batcher at less than 30% of the scale capacity, \nis measured accurately to ±0.3% of scale capacity or ±3% of the required cumulative weight, whichever is \nless. \nMeasure cement in number of bags under special circumstances when approved. Use the weights specified \non the packaging. Weighing bags of cement is not required. Ensure fractional bags are not used except for \nsmall hand-mixed batches of approximately 5 cu. ft. or less and when an approved method of volumetric or \nweight measurement is used. \n4.5.2. Volumetric Mixers. Provide an accurate method of measuring all ingredients by volume and calibrate \nequipment to assure correct measurement of materials within the specified tolerances. Base tolerances on \nvolume-weight relationship established by calibration and measure the various ingredients within the \ntolerances shown in Table 13. Correct batch measurements for aggregate moisture content.  \n\n2024 Specifications  421 \n539 \nTable 13 \nMix Design Batching Tolerances—Volumetric Mixers \nMaterial Tolerance \nCement, wt. % 0 to +4 \nSCM, wt. % 0 to +4 \nFine aggregate, wt. % ±2 \nCoarse aggregate, wt. % ±2 \nAdmixtures, wt. or volume % ±3 \nWater, wt. or volume % ±1 \n4.6. Mixing and Delivering Concrete. \n4.6.1. Mixing Concrete. Operate mixers and agitators within the limits of the rated capacity and speed of rotation \nfor mixing and agitation as designated by the manufacturer of the equipment. Provide concrete in a \nthoroughly mixed and uniform mass with a satisfactory degree of uniformity when tested in accordance with \nTex-472-A\n. \nDo not top-load new concrete onto returned concrete. \nAdjust mixing times and batching operations as necessary when the concrete contains silica fume to ensure \nthe material is completely and uniformly dispersed in the mix. The dispersion of the silica fume within the mix \nwill be verified by MTD using cylinders made from trial batches. Make necessary changes to the batching \noperations, if uniform dispersion is not achieved, until uniform and complete dispersion of the silica fume is \nachieved. \nMix concrete by hand methods or in a small motor-driven mixer when permitted, for small placements of less \nthan 2 cu. yd. For such placements, proportion the mix by volume or weight. \n4.6.2. Delivering Concrete. Deliver concrete to the project in a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass, and discharge \nthe concrete with a satisfactory degree of uniformity. Conduct testing in accordance with Tex-472-A\n when \nthere is a reason to suspect the uniformity of concrete and as directed. \nMaintain concrete delivery and placement rates sufficient to prevent cold joints. \nAdding chemical admixtures or the portion of water withheld is permitted only at the jobsite, under the \nsupervision of the Engineer, to adjust the slump or slump flow of the concrete. Do not add water or chemical \nadmixtures to the batch after more than an amount needed to conduct slump testing has been discharged. \nTurn the drum or blades at least 30 additional revolutions at mixing speed to ensure thorough and uniform \nmixing of the concrete. When this water is added, do not exceed the approved mix design w/cm ratio.  \nWhen truck mixers are equipped with automated water or chemical admixture measurement and slump or \nslump flow monitoring equipment, the addition of water or chemical admixtures during transit is allowed. \nReports generated by this equipment must be submitted to the Engineer daily. \nBefore unloading, furnish the delivery ticket for the batch of concrete containing the information required in \naccordance with ASTM C94. The Engineer will verify all required information is provided on the delivery \ntickets. The Engineer may suspend concrete operations until the corrective actions are implemented if \ndelivery tickets do not provide the required information. The Engineer will verify the design w/cm ratio is not \nexceeded. \nAn electronic ticket delivery system (e-ticketing) may be used instead of printed tickets. The use of e-ticketing \nwill require written approval. At minimum, the system will: \n provide electronic, real-time e-tickets meeting the requirements above; \n automatically generate e-tickets using software and hardware fully integrated with the batch plant scales \nused to weigh the material;  \n\n2024 Specifications  421 \n540 \n be able to record all water and chemical admixture additions performed at the jobsite or in transit when \nallowed; \n provide the ability to associate fresh concrete test results with each e-ticket; \n be designed in such a way that data input cannot be altered by the Contractor or the Engineer; \n provide the Engineer access to the e-ticketing data in real-time using a web-based or app-based system \ncompatible with iOS; and \n provide offline capabilities to prevent data loss if power or connectivity is lost. \nThe Engineer may discontinue use of the e-ticketing and require printed tickets as needed if the e-ticketing \nsystem fails to meet the above requirements. \nBegin the discharge of concrete delivered in truck mixers within the times shown in Table 14. Concrete \ndelivered after these times and concrete that has not begun to discharge within these times will be rejected. \nThe discharge times shown in Table 14 may be extended provided slump loss testing is conducted in \naccordance with Tex-430-A\n to show concrete will maintain the minimum required slump for the requested \ndischarge time extension. Extended discharge times will be allowed when the concrete temperature at time \nof discharge is no more than 10°F higher than the slump loss test concrete temperature.  \n \nTable 14 \nConcrete Discharge Times for Truck Mixers \nFresh Concrete  \nTemperature, °F \nMax Time After Batching for \nConcrete Not Containing \nType B or D Admixtures, min. \nMax Time After Batching for \nConcrete Containing  \nType B or D Admixtures,\n1\n min. \n90 and above 45 75 \n75 ≤T <90 60 90 \nT <75 90 120 \n1.

Place, finish, and cure concrete in conformance with the \npertinent Items. \n4.8. Sampling and Testing of Concrete. Unless otherwise specified, all fresh and hardened concrete is subject \nto testing as follows. \n4.8.1. Certification of Testing Personnel. Contractor personnel performing testing must be either ACI-certified or \nqualified by a Department-recognized equivalent written and performance testing program for the tests being \nperformed. Personnel performing these tests are subject to Department approval. Use of a commercial \nlaboratory is permitted at the Contractor’s option.  \n4.8.2. Fresh Concrete. Provide safe access and assistance to the Engineer during sampling. Fresh concrete will \nbe sampled for testing at the point of discharge from the delivery equipment or end of belt conveyors. \n4.8.3. Testing Concrete.  The Engineer, unless specified in other Items or shown on the plans, will test the fresh \nand hardened concrete in accordance with the following methods. \n Slump. Tex-415-A\n \n Air Content. Tex-414-A  or Tex-416-A, only when air-entrained concrete is shown on the plans \n Temperature. Tex-422-A \n Making and Curing Strength Specimens. Tex-447-A \n Compressive Strength. Tex-418-A \n Flexural Strength. Tex-448-A \n Maturity. Tex-426-A \nFlexural strength and maturity specimens will not be made unless specified in other Items or shown on the \nplans.  \n\n2024 Specifications  421 \n541 \nConcrete with slump less than minimum required after all addition of water withheld will be rejected, unless \notherwise allowed by the Engineer. Concrete with slump exceeding maximum allowed may be used at the \nContractor’s option. If used, Engineer will make, test, and evaluate strength specimens in accordance with \nArticle 421.5., “Acceptance of Concrete.” Acceptance of concrete not meeting air content or temperature \nrequirements will be determined by Engineer. Fresh concrete exhibiting segregation and excessive bleeding \nwill be rejected. \n4.8.3.1. Strength Specimen Handling. After strength test specimens are molded, protect and cure in conformance \nwith pertinent test methods. When necessary, deliver Contractor-molded specimens to curing facilities, \nremove specimens from their molds, and place specimens in curing tanks within 24–48 hr. after molding, in \nconformance with pertinent test methods. The Engineer will deliver Department-molded specimens to curing \nfacilities, remove specimens from their molds, and place specimens in curing tanks within 24–48 hr. after \nmolding, in conformance with pertinent test methods.  \n5. ACCEPTANCE OF CONCRETE \nThe Engineer will sample and test the fresh and hardened concrete for acceptance. The test results will be \nreported to the Contractor and the concrete supplier. Investigate the quality of the materials, the concrete \nproduction operations, and other possible problem areas to determine the cause for any concrete that fails to \nmeet the required strengths as specified below. Take necessary actions to correct the problem, including \nredesign of the concrete mix. The Engineer may suspend all concrete operations under the pertinent Items if \nthe Contractor is unable to Identify, document, and correct the cause of the low strengths in a timely manner. \nResume concrete operations only after obtaining approval for any proposed corrective actions. Concrete \nfailing to meet the required strength as specified below will be evaluated in accordance with Article 421.6., \n“Measurement and Payment.” \n5.1. Structural Class of Concrete. For concrete classes identified as structural concrete shown in Table 8, the \nEngineer will make and test 7-day and 28-day specimens, and, if necessary, 56-day specimens. The \nEngineer will base acceptance on attaining the design strength shown in Table 8 or design strength shown \non the plans. \n5.2. Class P and Class High Early Strength (HES). The Engineer will base acceptance in accordance with \nItem 360 and Item 361, “Repair of Concrete Pavement.” \n5.3. All Other Classes of Concrete. For concrete classes not identified as structural concrete in Table 8, the \nEngineer will make and test 7-day specimens. The Engineer will base acceptance on attaining design \nstrength or attaining the 7-day target value established in accordance with Tex-427-A\n. \n6. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT \nThe work performed, materials furnished, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals will not be measured or \npaid for directly, but will be subsidiary to pertinent Items. \nThe following procedure will be used to evaluate concrete where one or more project acceptance test \nspecimens fail to meet the required design strength specified in this Item or shown on the plans. \n The concrete for a given placement will be considered structurally adequate and accepted at full price if \nthe average of 28-day or 56-day set of specimens made at the time of placement meets the required \ndesign strength, provided no single specimen test result is less than 85% of the required design \nstrength. \n The Engineer will perform a structural review of the concrete to determine its adequacy to remain in \nservice if the average 28-day or 56-day set of specimens made at the time of placement is less than the \nrequired design strength or if any single specimen test result is less than 85% of the required design \nstrength. If the concrete is determined to be structurally adequate, the Engineer will determine the limits \nof the payment adjustment using the formula below. \n\n2024 Specifications  421 \n542 \n If the in situ concrete strength is needed for the structural review, take cores at locations designated by \nthe Engineer in accordance with Tex-424-A\n. The Engineer will test the cores. The coring and testing will \nbe at the Contractor’s expense. \n If all the tested cores meet the required design strength, the concrete will be paid for at full price. \n If any of the tested cores do not meet the required design strength, but the average strength attained is \ndetermined to be structurally adequate, the Engineer will determine the limits of the payment adjustment \nusing the following formula. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−=32.569.1137.5 \n2\ns\na\ns\na\np\nS\nS\nS\nS\nBA\n \nwhere: \nA = Amount to be paid per unit of measure for the entire placement in question. \nS\na\n = Actual average strength from cylinders or cores. Use values from cores, if taken. \nS\ns\n = Minimum required strength (specified). \nB\np\n = Unit bid price. \n If the structural review determines the concrete is not adequate to remain in service, the Engineer will \ndetermine the limits of the concrete to be removed. \n The decision to reject structurally inadequate concrete or to apply the payment adjustment factor will be \nmade no later than 7 days after 28-day or 56-day design strength specimens, or cores, if taken, are \ntested. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n543 \n \nItem 422 \nConcrete Superstructures \n1.

Equip transverse screeds with a pan float and skew kit. \nManually operated screeding equipment may be used if approved for top slabs of culverts, small placements, \nor unusual conditions. Use screeds that are rigid and heavy enough to hold true to shape and have sufficient \nadjustments to provide for the required camber or section. Equip the screeds, except those of the roller drum \ntype, with metal cutting edges. \nUse sufficient work bridges for finishing operations for bridge slabs. Mount a carpet drag to a work bridge or \na movable support system that can vary the area of carpet in contact with the concrete. Use carpet pieces \nlong enough to cover the entire width of the placement. Splice or overlap the carpet as necessary. Ensure \nenough carpet is in contact longitudinally with the concrete being placed to provide the desired surface finish. \nUse artificial grass-type carpeting with a molded polyethylene pile face with a blade length between 5/8 and \n1   in.    and minimum weight of 70 oz. per square yard. Ensure the carpet has a strong, durable backing not \nsubject to rot and the facing is adequately bonded to the backing to withstand the intended use. A burlap \ndrag, attached to the pan float on a transverse screed, may be used instead of the carpet drag. \n3.5. Temperature Recording Equipment.

Use sawing equipment capable of cutting grooves in hardened concrete within 18 in.    of the barrier rail \nor curb. \n3.8. Spraying Equipment. Use mechanically powered pressure sprayers with appropriate atomizing nozzles for \nthe application of membrane curing. Mechanically driven spraying equipment, adaptable to the rail system \nused by the screeds, may be used for applying membrane curing to bridge slabs. Use hand-pressurized \nspray equipment with two or three fan-spray nozzles if approved. Ensure the spray from each nozzle \noverlaps the spray from adjacent nozzles by approximately 50%. \n3.9. Concrete Testing Equipment. Provide testing equipment for the Engineer’s use in accordance with \nSection 421.3.3., “Testing Equipment.” \n4. CONSTRUCTION \nObtain approval for proposed construction methods before starting work. Approval of construction methods \nand equipment does not relieve the Contractor’s responsibility for safety or correctness of methods, \nadequacy of equipment, or completion of work in full accordance with the Contract. Attend the \npreconstruction (pre-pour) meetings for bridge slabs conducted by the Engineer. Provide and obtain approval \nfor proposed finishing methods, interim curing methods, and final curing methods. \nUnless otherwise shown on the plans, it is the Contractor’s option to perform testing on structural concrete \n(structural classes of concrete are identified in Table 8 of Section 421.4.1., “Classification of Concrete Mix \nDesigns”) to determine the in   situ strength to address the schedule restrictions listed below. The Engineer \nmay require the Contractor to perform this testing for concrete placed in cold weather. Make enough test \nspecimens for Contractor-performed testing to ensure strength requirements are met for the operations listed \nbelow. Make at least one set of test specimens for each element cast each day. Cure these specimens under \nthe same conditions as the portion of the structure involved for all stages of construction. Ensure safe \nhandling, curing, and storage of all test specimens. Provide testing personnel, and sample and test the \nhardened concrete in accordance with Section 421.4.8., “Sampling and Testing of Concrete.” The maturity \nmethod, Tex-426-A\n, may be used for in-situ strength determination for schedule restrictions if approved. \nCoring will not be allowed for in-situ strength determination for schedule restrictions. Provide the Engineer \nthe opportunity to witness all testing operations. Report all test results to the Engineer. \nIf the Contractor does not wish to perform schedule restriction testing, the Engineer’s 7-day lab-cured tests, \nperformed in accordance with Article 421.5., “Acceptance of Concrete,” will be used for schedule restriction \ndeterminations. The Engineer may require additional time for strength gain to account for field curing \nconditions such as cold weather. \n4.1. Schedule Restrictions and Inspection Hold-Points. \n4.1.1. Placement of Superstructure Members. Place or cast superstructure members after the substructure \nconcrete has attained a compressive strength of 3,000 psi. \n4.1.2.

Submit similar plans for other units of the \nsuperstructure as directed. Show all essential details of proposed forms and bracing. Have a licensed \nprofessional engineer design, seal, and sign these plans. Department approval is not required, but the \nDepartment reserves the right to request modifications to the plans. The Contractor is responsible for the \nadequacy of these plans. \nDesign job-fabricated formwork assuming a weight of 150 pcf for concrete, and include a minimum live load \nallowance of 50 psf of horizontal surface of the form. Do not exceed 125% of the allowable stresses used by \nthe Department for the design of structures. \nUse conventional forms, permanent metal deck forms, or prestressed concrete panels for slabs on beams or \ngirders unless specified otherwise. Use permanent metal deck forms or conventional forms for thickened \nslabs, diaphragms, or other regions as shown on the plans where prestressed concrete panels are not used. \nProvide prestressed concrete panels as shown on the plans and in accordance with Item 424, “Precast \nConcrete Structural Members (Fabrication).” Provide copies of the precast panel layout drawings from the \npanel fabricator. \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n547 \nUse only material that is inert, nonbiodegradable, and nonabsorptive for forms to be left in place. \nOverhang form supports that transmit a horizontal force to a steel girder or beam or to a prestressed \nconcrete beam are permitted provided a satisfactory structural analysis has been made of the effect on the \ngirder or beam as shown on the submitted formwork plans. \nUse beam bracing as shown on the plans when overhang brackets are used on prestressed concrete beam \nspans with slab overhangs not exceeding 3 ft. 6 in.    Provide and design additional support or bracing for the \noutside beams regardless of the type of beam used for spans with overhangs exceeding this amount. \nAttachment of forms or screed supports for bridge slabs to steel I-beams or girders may be by welding \nsubject to the following requirements. \n Do not weld to tension flanges or to areas indicated on the plans. \n Weld in accordance with Item 448, “Structural Field Welding.” \nWhen setting forms of any type, consider:  \n deflections due to cast-in-place slab concrete and railing shown in the dead load deflection diagram, \n differential beam or girder deflections due to skew angles and the use of certain stay-in-place slab \nforming systems, and \n deflection of the forming system due to the wet concrete. \nSecurely stake forms to line and grade and maintain in position for bridge approach slabs. Rigidly attach \ninside forms for curbs to the outside forms. \nConstruct all forms to permit their removal without marring or damaging the concrete. Clean all forms and \nfooting areas of any extraneous matter before placing concrete. Provide openings in forms if needed for the \nremoval of laitance or foreign matter. \nTreat the facing of all forms with bond-breaking coating of composition that will not discolor or injuriously \naffect the concrete surface. Take care to prevent coating of the reinforcing steel. \nComplete all preparatory work before placing concrete. \n4.2.1. Precast Panels. Profile each beam to determine the actual camber or sag of the beams before placing \npanels. Adjust the profile grade line, panel elevation, and bearing seat elevations as needed to obtain the \nrequired cover over the slab reinforcement and slab thickness while maintaining ride quality. Make \nadjustments over suitable increments when a profile grade line adjustment is necessary, depending on span \nlengths, so the revised grade line will produce a uniform profile and good riding qualities. Obtain approval for \nthe grade adjustments before placement. Consider actual beam camber in adjacent spans or slab \nplacements when adjusting the grade line. Inspect each panel before being placed for cracks and other \ndamage. Refer to Section 424.4.3.1., “Defects and Breakage,” for rejection criteria due to cracking and other \ndamage. \n4.2.2. Permanent Metal Decking. Submit signed and sealed design calculations in addition to the required \nformwork drawings. Design and install formwork as shown on the plans and formwork drawings. The plans \nwill govern in cases where the plans and the formwork drawings conflict. \n4.2.3. Conventional Forms. Provide properly seasoned good-quality lumber free of imperfections that would affect \nits strength or impair the finished surface of the concrete. Provide timber or lumber that meets or exceeds the \nrequirements for species and grade shown on the submitted formwork plans. \nMaintain forms or form lumber that will be reused so that it stays clean and in good condition. Do not use any \nlumber that is split, warped, bulged, or marred or that has any defect that will produce inferior work; remove \nsuch lumber from the work. \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n548 \nUse plywood at least 3/4 in.    thick. Use plywood for forming surfaces that remain exposed that meets the \nrequirements for B-B Plyform Class I or Class II Exterior of the U.S. Department of Commerce Voluntary \nProduct Standard PS 1. \nSpace studs and joists so that the facing form material remains in true alignment under the imposed loads. \nPlace forms with the form panels symmetrically (long dimensions set in the same direction) for surfaces \nexposed to view and receiving only an ordinary surface finish as defined in Section 420.4.13., “Ordinary \nSurface Finish.” Make horizontal joints continuous. \nMake molding for chamfer strips or other uses of materials of a grade that will not split when nailed and can \nbe maintained to a true line without warping. Dress wood molding on all faces. Fill forms at all sharp corners \nand edges with triangular chamfer strips measuring 3/4 in.    on the sides unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n4.3. Placing Reinforcement. Place reinforcement as provided in Item 440. Do not weld reinforcing steel supports \nto I-beams or girders or to reinforcing steel except as shown on the plans. \n4.4. Drains. Install and construct weep holes and roadway drains as shown on the plans. \n4.5. Extending Existing Slabs. Verify pertinent dimensions and elevations of the existing structure before \nordering any required materials. \n4.5.1. Removal. Remove portions of the existing structure to the lines and dimensions shown on the plans or as \ndirected. Dispose of these materials as shown on the plans or as directed. Remove any metal railing without \ndamaging it, and stack it neatly on the right of way at locations that do not interfere with traffic or construction \nor at locations shown on the plans. All removed metal railing remains the property of the Department unless \notherwise shown on the plans. Repair any portion of the remaining structure damaged as a result of the \nconstruction. Do not use explosives to remove portions of the existing structure unless approved in writing. \nDo not use a demolition ball, other swinging weight, or impact equipment unless shown on the plans. Use \npneumatic or hydraulic tools for final removal of concrete at the “break” line. Use removal equipment, as \napproved, that will not damage the remaining concrete. \n4.5.2. Reuse of Removed Portions of Structure. Detach and remove all portions of the old structure that are to \nbe incorporated into the extended structure to the lines and details as shown on the plans or as directed. \nMove the unit to be reused to the new location specified using approved methods. Place the reinforcement \nand extension concrete as shown on the plans. \n4.5.3. Breaking Back Bridge Slabs. Saw the top surface of the slab for bridge slabs and direct traffic slabs of box \nculverts along the “break” line to a depth of 1/2 in.    before breaking back. Do not cut the reinforcement at the \n“break” line. Sever the concrete at the “break” line. Do not damage the remaining reinforcement within \none lap length of the “break” line during removal of the designated portion of the existing structure. \n4.5.4. Splicing Reinforcing Steel. Splice new reinforcing bars to exposed bars in the existing structure using lap \nsplices in accordance with Item 440 unless otherwise shown on the plans. The new reinforcing steel does not \nneed to be tied to the existing steel where spacing or elevation does not match that of the existing steel, \nprovided the lap length is attained. Weld in accordance with Item 448 when welded splices are permitted. \nInstall any required dowels in accordance with Section 422.4.6.10., “Installation of Dowels and Anchor Bolts.” \n4.5.5. Concrete Preparation. Roughen and clean concrete surfaces that are in contact with new construction \nbefore the placing of forms. Prepare these construction joint surfaces in accordance with Section 422.4.6.7., \n“Construction Joints.” \n4.6. Placing Concrete. Do not place concrete unless approval is obtained for the hold-point inspections in \naccordance with Section 422.4.1.10., “Inspection Hold-Points,” and the pre-pour meeting has been \nconducted. Give the Engineer sufficient advance notice before placing concrete in any unit of the structure to \npermit the final inspection of forms, reinforcing steel placement, and other preparations. Obtain approval for \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n549 \nproposed curing methods based on forecast weather conditions for the expected duration of the pour and \nuse the evaporation rate nomograph as mentioned below to determine the required curing options. \nFollow the sequence of placing concrete shown on the plans or specified. \nDo not place concrete when impending weather conditions would impair the quality of the finished work. \nPlace concrete in early morning or at night or adjust the placement schedule for more favorable weather if \nconditions of wind, humidity, and temperature are such that concrete cannot be placed without the potential \nfor plastic shrinkage cracking. Consult the evaporation rate nomograph in PCA’s Design and Control of \nConcrete Mixtures or the evaporation rate spreadsheet available on the Department’s website for shrinkage \ncracking potential. Adequately illuminate the entire placement site when mixing, placing, and finishing \nconcrete in non-daylight hours as approved. \nFurnish adequate shelter to protect the concrete against damage from rainfall or from freezing temperatures \nin    accordance with this Item if changes in weather conditions require protective measures after work starts. \nContinue operations during rainfall only if approved. Use protective coverings for the material stockpiles. \nCover aggregate stockpiles only to the extent necessary to control the moisture conditions in the aggregates. \nAllow at least 1 curing day after the concrete has achieved initial set before placing strain on projecting \nreinforcement to prevent damage to the concrete. \n4.6.1. Placing Temperature. Place superstructure concrete only when its temperature at the time of placement is \nbetween 50 and 85°F. Increase the minimum placement temperature to 60°F if slag cement is used in the \nconcrete. \n4.6.2. Transporting Time. Begin the discharge of concrete delivered in truck mixers within the times shown in \nTable 14 of Item 421. \n4.6.3. Workability of Concrete. Place concrete with a slump as specified in Section 421.4.2.5., “Slump.” Placing \nconcrete with slump exceeding maximum specified may result in bridge deck cracking and be subject to \nSection 422.4.10., “Defective Work.” Water may be added to the concrete before discharging any concrete \nfrom the truck to adjust for low slump, provided the maximum mix design water-cement ratio is not exceeded. \nMix concrete after introduction of any additional water or chemical admixtures in accordance with \nSection 421.4.6., “Mixing and Delivering Concrete.” Do not add water or chemical admixtures after any \nconcrete has been discharged. \n4.6.4. Transporting Concrete. Use a method and equipment capable of maintaining the rate of placement shown \non the plans or required by this Item to transport concrete to the forms. Transport concrete by buckets, \nchutes, buggies, belt conveyors, pumps, or other methods. \nProtect concrete transported by conveyors from sun and wind to prevent loss of slump and workability. \nShade or wrap with wet burlap pipes through which concrete is pumped as necessary to prevent loss of \nslump and workability. \nArrange and use chutes, troughs, conveyors, or pipes so the concrete ingredients will not be separated. \nTerminate such equipment in vertical downspouts, when necessary, to prevent segregation. Extend open \ntroughs and chutes, if necessary, down inside the forms or through holes left in the forms. \nKeep all transporting equipment clean and free of hardened concrete coatings. Discharge water used for \ncleaning clear of the concrete. \n4.6.5. Preparation of Surfaces. Thoroughly wet all forms, prestressed concrete panels, T-beams, slab beams, and \nconcrete box beams on which concrete is to be placed before placing concrete on them. Remove free water \nfrom the surface or beam lines before placing concrete. Provide surfaces that are in a moist, saturated \nsurface-dry (SSD) condition when concrete is placed on them. Ensure the surface of the existing concrete is \nin an SSD condition just before placing subsequent concrete. Prewet the existing concrete by ponding water \non the surface for 24 hr. before placing subsequent concrete. Use high-pressure water blasting to achieve \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n550 \nSSD conditions 15–30 min. before placing the concrete if ponding is not possible. An SSD condition is \nachieved when the surface remains damp when exposed to sunlight for 15 min. \nEnsure the subgrade or foundation is moist before placing concrete for bridge approach slabs. \n4.6.6. Expansion Joints. Construct joints and devices to provide for expansion and contraction as shown on the \nplans and in accordance with this Section and Item 454, “Bridge Expansion Joints.” \nPrevent bridging of concrete or mortar around expansion joint material in bearings and expansion joints. \nUse forms adaptable to loosening or early removal in construction of all open joints and joints to be filled with \nexpansion joint material. Loosen these forms as soon as possible after final concrete set to permit free \nmovement of the span without requiring full form removal and avoid expansion or contraction damage to the \nadjacent concrete. \nEnsure that finished joints conform to the plan details with the concrete sections completely separated by the \nspecified opening or joint material. \nRemove all concrete within the joint opening soon after form removal and again where necessary after \nsurface finishing to ensure full effectiveness of the expansion joint. \n4.6.7. Construction Joints. A construction joint is formed by placing plastic concrete in direct contact with \nconcrete that has attained its initial set. Monolithic placement means the manner and sequence of concrete \nplacing do not create a construction joint. \nMake construction joints of the type and at the locations shown on the plans. Do not make joints in bridge \nslabs not shown on the plans unless approved. Additional joints in other members are not permitted without \napproval. Place authorized additional joints using details equivalent to those shown on the plans for joints in \nsimilar locations. \nMake construction joints square and normal to the forms unless otherwise required. Use bulkheads in the \nforms for all vertical joints. \nThoroughly clean the hardened concrete surface of all loose material, laitance, dirt, and foreign matter, and \nsaturate it with water. Remove all free water and moisten the surface before concrete or bonding grout is \nplaced against it. Ensure the surface of the existing concrete is in an SSD condition just before placing \nsubsequent concrete. Prewet the existing concrete by ponding water on the surface for 24 hr. before placing \nsubsequent concrete. Use high-pressure water blasting to achieve SSD conditions 15–30 min. before placing \nthe concrete if ponding is not possible. An SSD condition is achieved when the surface remains damp when \nexposed to sunlight for 15 min. \nDraw forms tight against the existing concrete to avoid mortar loss and offsets at joints. \nBonding agents are not required unless specified otherwise. Coat the joint surface with bonding mortar, \ngrout, epoxy, or other material as shown on the plans or in conformance with other Items if a bonding agent \nis required. Provide Type V epoxy in accordance with DMS-6100\n for bonding fresh concrete to hardened \nconcrete. Place the bonding epoxy on a clean, dry surface, and place the fresh concrete while the epoxy is \nstill tacky. Place bonding mortar or grout on a surface that is SSD and place the concrete before the bonding \nmortar or grout dries. Place other bonding agents in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. \n4.6.8. Handling and Placing. Minimize segregation of the concrete and displacement of the reinforcement when \nhandling and placing concrete. Produce a uniform, dense, compact mass. \nDo not allow concrete to free-fall more than 5 ft. Remove any hardened concrete splatter ahead of the plastic \nconcrete. \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n551 \nFill each part of the forms by depositing concrete as near its final position as possible. Do not deposit large \nquantities at one point and run or work the concrete along the forms. \nAvoid cold joints in a monolithic placement. Sequence successive layers or adjacent portions of concrete so \nthey can be vibrated into a homogeneous mass with the previously placed concrete before it sets. \n4.6.9. Consolidation. Carefully consolidate concrete and flush mortar to the form surfaces using immersion type \nvibrators. Do not use vibrators that operate by attachment to forms or reinforcement except where approved \non steel forms. \nVibrate the concrete immediately after deposit. Systematically space points of vibration to ensure complete \nconsolidation and thorough working of the concrete around the reinforcement and embedded fixtures, and \ninto the corners and angles of the forms. Insert the vibrator vertically where possible, except for slabs where \nit may be inserted in a sloping or horizontal position. Vibrate the entire depth of each lift, allowing the vibrator \nto penetrate several inches into the preceding lift. Do not use the vibrator to move the concrete to other \nlocations in the forms. Do not drag the vibrator through the concrete. Thoroughly consolidate concrete along \nconstruction joints by operating the vibrator along and close to but not against the joint surface. Continue the \nvibration until the concrete surrounding reinforcements and fixtures is completely consolidated. Hand-spade \nor rod the concrete if necessary to ensure flushing of mortar to the surface of all forms. Concentrate vibration \nefforts along the beam lines when precast concrete panels are used for deck construction. \n4.6.10. Installation of Dowels and Anchor Bolts. Install dowels and anchor bolts by casting them in place or by \ngrouting with grout, epoxy, or epoxy mortar unless specified otherwise. Form or drill holes for grouting. Use \nonly epoxy when installing horizontal dowels into the edges of slabs. Follow the manufacturer’s \nrecommended installation procedures for pre-packaged grout or epoxy anchor systems. Test anchors if \nrequired on the plans or by other Items. \nDrill holes for anchor bolts to accommodate the bolt embedment required by the plans. Make holes for \ndowels at least 12 in.    deep unless otherwise shown on the plans. Make the hole diameter at least twice the \ndowel or bolt diameter, but the hole need not exceed the dowel or bolt diameter plus 1-1/2 in.    when using \ncementitious grout or epoxy mortar. Make the hole diameter 1/16–1/4 in.    greater than the dowel or bolt \ndiameter when using neat epoxy,  unless specified otherwise by the epoxy manufacturer. \nThoroughly clean holes of all loose material, oil, grease, or other bond-breaking substance, and blow them \nclean with filtered compressed air. Use a wire brush followed by oil-free compressed air to remove all loose \nmaterial from the holes, repeating as necessary until no more material is removed. Ensure holes are in a \nsurface-dry condition when epoxy type materials are used and in a surface-moist condition when \ncementitious grout is used. Develop and demonstrate for approval a procedure for cleaning and preparing \nthe holes for installation of the dowels and anchor bolts. Completely fill the void between the hole and dowel \nor bolt with grouting material. Follow exactly the requirements for cleaning in conformance with the product \nspecifications for pre-packaged systems. \nProvide a Type III epoxy  in accordance with DMS-6100\n when neat epoxy is used for anchor bolts or dowels. \nProvide Type VIII epoxy in accordance with DMS-6100 when an epoxy grout is used. Provide grout, epoxy, \nor epoxy mortar as the binding agent unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nProvide other anchor systems as shown on the plans. \n4.6.11. Placing Concrete in Cold Weather. Protect concrete placed under weather conditions where weather may \nadversely affect results. Permission given by the Engineer for placing during cold weather does not relieve \nthe Contractor of responsibility for producing concrete equal in quality to that placed under normal conditions. \nIf concrete placed under poor conditions is unsatisfactory, remove and replace it as directed at Contractor’s \nexpense. \nDo not place concrete in contact with any material coated with frost or with a temperature of 32°F or lower. \nDo not place concrete when the ambient temperature in the shade is below 40°F and falling unless \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n552 \napproved. Place concrete when the ambient temperature in the shade is at least 35°F and rising or above \n40°F. \nProvide and install recording thermometers, maturity meters, or other suitable temperature measuring \ndevices to verify all concrete is effectively protected. Maintain the temperature of the top surface of bridge \nslabs and top slabs of direct traffic culverts at 50°F or above for 72 hr. from the time of placement and above \n40°F for an additional 72 hr. \nUse additional covering, insulated forms, or other means and, if necessary, supplement the covering with \nartificial heating. Avoid applying heat directly to concrete surfaces. Cure as specified in Section 422.4.8., \n“Final Curing,” during this period until all requirements for curing have been satisfied. \nHave on hand all necessary heating and covering material, ready for use, before permission is granted to \nbegin placement when impending weather conditions indicate the possible need for temperature protection. \nDistress caused by concrete drying out as a result of delayed set and strength gain associated with cold \nweather are a result of the Contractor’s actions and are subject to repair in accordance with \nSection 422.4.10., “Defective Work.” \n4.6.12. Placing Concrete in Hot Weather. Use an approved Type B or Type D set retarding agent in all concrete \nfor superstructures and top slabs of direct traffic culverts, except concrete containing slag cement, when the \ntemperature of the air is above 85°F, unless otherwise directed. \nKeep the concrete at or below the maximum temperature at time of placement as specified above. Sprinkle \nand shade aggregate stockpiles or use ice, liquid nitrogen systems, or other approved methods as necessary \nto control the concrete temperature. \n4.6.13. Placing Concrete in Superstructure. Place simple span bridge slabs without transverse construction joints \nby using either a self-propelled transverse finishing machine or a mechanical longitudinal screed unless \notherwise shown on the plans. Use of manually operated screeding equipment may be permitted for small \nplacements or for unusual conditions such as narrow widening, variable cross-slopes, or transitions. Support \nthe screed adequately on a header or rail system stable enough to withstand the longitudinal or lateral thrust \nof the equipment. Adjust the profile grade line as necessary to account for variations in beam camber and \nother factors to obtain the required slab thickness and concrete cover over the slab reinforcement. Set \nbeams and verify their surface elevations in a sufficient number of spans so that when adjustment is \nnecessary, the profile grade line can be adjusted over suitable increments to produce a smooth riding \nsurface. Take dead load deflection into account in setting the grades of headers and rail systems. Use \nconstruction joints when required or permitted for slab placements on steel or prestressed concrete beams, \nas shown on the plans. Release falsework under the spans before placing concrete on steel girder or truss \nspans, and swing the spans free on their permanent supports. \nProvide additional camber to offset the initial and final deflections of the span as shown on the plans for \nconcrete flat slab, concrete slab, and girder spans cast in place on falsework. Provide camber of \napproximately 3/8 in.    for 30-ft. spans and 1/2 in.    for 40-ft. spans to offset initial and final deflections for \nconcrete slab and girder spans using pan forms, unless otherwise directed. Provide a camber of 1/8 in.    for \n10-ft. spans but no more than 1/2 in.    for concrete flat slab, concrete slab, and girder spans not using pan \nforms when dead load deflection is not shown on the plans. \nProvide a camber of 1/4 in.    in addition to deflection for slabs without vertical curvature on steel or \nprestressed concrete beams. Provide camber for specified vertical curvature and transverse slopes. \nMake one or more passes with the screed over the bridge slab segment before placing concrete on it to \nensure proper operation and maintenance of grades and clearances. Use an approved system of checking to \ndetect any vertical movement of the forms or falsework. Maintain forms for the bottom surface of concrete \nslabs, girders, and overhangs to the required vertical alignment during concrete placing. \nLevel, strike off, and screed the surface while carrying a slight excess of concrete ahead of the screed to fill \nall low spots as soon as the concrete has been placed and vibrated in a section wide enough to permit \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n553 \nworking. Move longitudinal screeds across the concrete with a saw-like motion while their ends rest on \nheaders or templates set true to the roadway grade or on the adjacent finished slab. Move transverse \nscreeds longitudinally approximately 1/5 of the drum length for each complete out-and-back pass of the \ncarriage. Screed the surface of the concrete enough times and at intervals to produce a uniform surface true \nto grade and free of voids. \nFog unformed surfaces of slab concrete in bridge slabs and in top slabs of direct traffic culverts from the time \nof initial strike-off of the concrete until finishing is completed and required interim curing is in place. Do not \nuse fogging to add finishing water, and do not work moisture from the fog spray into the fresh concrete. \nRetard the concrete for simple spans only if necessary to complete finishing operations or as required by this \nSection. Bring the top of curb and sidewalk section to the correct camber and alignment when filling curb \nforms and finish them in accordance with this Item. \n4.6.13.1. Transverse Screeding. Install rails for transverse finishing machines that are supported from the beams or \ngirders so the supports may be removed without damage to the slab. Prevent bonding between removable \nsupports and the concrete in an acceptable manner. Do not allow rail support parts that remain embedded in \nthe slab to project above the upper mat of reinforcing steel. Rail or screed supports attached to I-beams or \ngirders are subject to the requirements of this Item. Place concrete at a minimum rate of 30 ft. of bridge slab \nper hour for transverse screeding unless otherwise shown on the plans. Deposit concrete parallel to the skew \nof the bridge so all girders are loaded uniformly along their length. Deposit slab concrete between the \nexterior beam and adjacent beam before placing concrete in the overhang portion of the slab. Furnish \npersonnel and equipment capable of placing, finishing, and curing the slab at an acceptable rate to ensure \ncompliance with the specifications. Place concrete in transverse strips. Start placement at the lowest end on \nprofile grades greater than 1-1/2%. \nAt the Contractor’s option, attach a pan drag and either a carpet or burlap drag to the screed assembly to \nfloat and provide surface micro-texture in one operation. Adjust the contact pressure of the pan drag to \nsmooth high spots and fill any depressions left by the screed. Adjust the weight or position of the carpet or \nburlap drag to produce a smooth sandy micro-texture without blemishes, marks, or scratches deeper than \n1/16 in.    Fill screed rail support holes and holes from the Engineer’s depth checks for slab thickness and \nreinforcing cover with concrete and finish them to match the rest of the slab. \n4.6.13.2. Longitudinal Screeding. Use of temporary intermediate headers will be permitted for placements over 50 ft. \nlong if the rate of placement is rapid enough to prevent a cold joint and if these headers are designed for \neasy removal to permit satisfactory consolidation and finish of the concrete at their locations, unless \notherwise shown on the plans. Deposit slab concrete between the exterior beam and the adjacent beam \nbefore placing concrete in the overhang portion of the slab. Place concrete in longitudinal strips starting at a \npoint in the center of the segment adjacent to one side, except as this Section specifies, and complete the \nstrip by placing uniformly in both directions toward the ends. Start placing at the lowest end for spans on a \nprofile grade of 1-1/2% or more. Use strips wide enough that the concrete within each strip remains plastic \nuntil placement of the adjacent strip. Place the concrete in proper sequence to be monolithic with the \nadjacent longitudinal strips of the slabs where monolithic curb construction is specified. \n4.6.13.3. Placements on Continuous Steel Units. Place slabs on continuous steel units in a single, continuous \noperation without transverse construction joints using a self-propelled transverse finishing machine or a \nmechanical longitudinal screed, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Retard the initial set of the concrete \nsufficiently to ensure concrete remains plastic in at least three spans immediately preceding the slab being \nplaced. Use construction joints, when required for slab placements on steel beams or girders, as shown on \nthe plans. Ensure the previously placed concrete attains a compressive strength of 3,000 psi when staged \nplacement of a slab is required on the plans before placing the next stage concrete. Multiple stages may be \nplaced in a single day if approved. Use an approved placing sequence that will not overstress any of the \nsupporting members where plans permit staged placing without specifying a particular order of placement. \n4.6.13.4. Slab and Girder Units. Place girders, slab, curbs of slab, and girder spans monolithically unless otherwise \nshown on the plans. Fill concrete girder stems first and place the slab concrete within the time limits specified \nin this Item. Place concrete in the stems for a short distance if using a transverse screed, and then place the \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n554 \nconcrete in transverse strips. Fill the outside girder stem first, beginning at the low end or side, if using a \nlongitudinal screed, and continue placement in longitudinal strips. \n4.7. Finish and Interim Curing of Bridge Slabs. Obtain approval of the proposed interim curing methods, \nequipment, and materials at the pre-pour meeting before placing concrete. Consider forecast weather \nconditions to determine the interim curing methods to use. \nUse work bridges or other suitable facilities to perform all finishing operations and to provide access, if \nnecessary, for the Engineer to check measurements for slab thickness and reinforcement cover. \nWork the screeded surface to a smooth finish using a long-handled wood or metal float, or hand-float it from \nwork bridges over the slab. Floating may not be necessary if the pan float attached to a transverse screed \nproduces an acceptable finish. Avoid overworking the surface of the concrete. Avoid use of finish water. \nPerform sufficient checks, witnessed by the Engineer, using a long-handled 10-ft. straightedge on the plastic \nconcrete to ensure the final surface will be within specified tolerances. Make the check with the straightedge \nparallel to the centerline. Lap each pass half over the preceding pass. Remove all high spots and fill and float \nall depressions more than 1/16 in.    deep with fresh concrete. Continue checking and floating until the surface \nis true to grade and free of depressions, high spots, voids, or rough spots. Fill screed-rail support holes with \nconcrete and finish them to match the top of the slab. \nProvide a uniform micro-texture using a carpet drag, burlap drag, or broom finish. Finish the surface to a \nsmooth sandy texture without blemishes, marks, or scratches deeper than 1/16 in.    Apply the surface \ntexturing using a work bridge or platform immediately after completing the straightedge checks. Draw the \ncarpet or burlap drag longitudinally along the concrete surface, adjusting the surface contact area or \npressure to provide a satisfactory coarsely textured surface. A broom finish may be performed using a \nfine-bristle broom transversely. For bridge approach slabs, the carpet drag, burlap drag, or broom finish may \nbe applied either longitudinally or transversely. \nEvaporation protection is required if the evaporation rate exceeds 0.10 lb. per square foot per hour in \naccordance with the Evaporation Calculation for Concrete Worksheet as shown on the Department’s \nwebsite, in accordance with the evaporation rate nomograph in PCA’s Design and Control of Concrete \nMixtures, or if shown on the plans. \n4.7.1. Evaporation Protection. Use one of the following methods for evaporation protection. \n4.7.1.1. Evaporation Retardant. Coat the concrete surface immediately after the carpet or burlap drag, or broom \nfinish with a single application of evaporation retardant at a rate recommended by the manufacturer. Do not \nallow more than 10 min. to elapse between the texturing at any location and application of evaporation \nretardant. The evaporation retardant may be applied using the same work bridge used for surface texturing. \nDo not work the concrete surface once the evaporation retardant has been applied. \n4.7.1.2. Wet Burlap. Place pre-wet burlap no more than 10 ft. behind the finishing operation. A work bridge may be \nrequired to avoid marring the surface. Ensure the wet burlap covers the entire surface. Use sprayers, hoses, \nsprinklers, or other similar methods to keep the burlap continuously wetted until application of the final curing. \n4.7.2. Interim Curing. Apply interim curing using one of the following options after applying the evaporation \nprotection (if needed). \n4.7.2.1. Membrane Cure. Apply membrane interim curing at a rate of approximately 180 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply \nbefore the water sheen disappears but do not place over standing water. Fog as necessary to maintain the \nwet sheen. Do not spray membrane curing on a dry surface. \n4.7.2.2. Wet Burlap. Place pre-wet burlap no more than 10 ft. behind the finishing operation. Burlap used for \nevaporation protection will also be considered as the interim curing. \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n555 \n4.8. Final Curing. Obtain approval of the proposed curing methods, equipment, and materials at the pre-pour \nmeeting before placing concrete. Inadequate curing or facilities may delay all concrete placements on the \nproject until remedial action is taken. Apply final curing as soon as possible after interim curing without \ndamaging the surface finish. Check the adequacy of the curing each day of the curing period. Take corrective \naction or modify the curing methods as needed to maintain a moist concrete surface. \nA curing day is a calendar day when the temperature, taken in the shade away from artificial heat, is above \n50°F for at least 19 hr. or, on colder days,  if the temperature of all surfaces of the concrete is maintained \nabove 40°F, for the entire 24 hr. The required curing period begins when all concrete has attained its initial \nset. Tex-440-A\n may be used to determine when the concrete has attained its initial set. \nCure all superstructure concrete according to the following, unless otherwise shown on the plans: \n Concrete using Type I or Type III cement: 8 days \n Concrete using Type I/II or Type II cement: 10 days \n Concrete with any type of supplementary cementing materials: 10 days \nPlace polyethylene sheeting, burlap-polyethylene blankets, laminated mats, or insulating curing mats in direct \ncontact with the slab when the air temperature is expected to drop below 40°F during the first 72 hr. of the \ncuring period. Weigh down these curing materials using dry mats to maintain direct contact with the concrete \nand provide insulation against cold weather. Supplemental heating or insulation may be required in cold and \nwet weather if the insulating cotton mats become wet or the concrete drops below the specified curing \ntemperature. Avoid applying heat directly to concrete surfaces. \nUse one of the following water curing methods for final curing. Keep all exposed surfaces of the concrete wet \ncontinuously for the required curing time. Use water for curing that meets the requirements for concrete \nmixing water in accordance with Section 421.2.5., “Water.” Do not use seawater or water that stains or \nleaves an unsightly residue. \n4.8.1. Cotton Mats. Keep the concrete continuously wet by maintaining wet cotton mats in direct contact with the \nconcrete for the required curing time. Weight the mats adequately to provide continuous contact with all \nconcrete. Cover surfaces that cannot be cured by direct contact with mats, forming an enclosure well \nanchored to the forms or ground so outside air cannot enter the enclosure. Provide sufficient moisture inside \nthe enclosure to keep all surfaces of the concrete wet. Use of soaker hoses and plastic covering is \nacceptable provided the concrete surface remains continuously wet for the required curing duration. \n4.8.2. Burlap Mats. The burlap used for interim curing may also be used for final curing if kept continuously wetted \nand completely covered with plastic sheeting. Overlap plastic sheeting and weigh down sufficiently so air \ncannot enter underneath the plastic. \n4.8.3. Burlap-P olyethylene Mats. Place these mats over soaker hoses or by other similar methods to keep the \nconcrete surface wetted for the duration of the curing period. Overlap the mats and weight down sufficiently \nso air cannot enter underneath the mats. \n4.9. Removal of Forms and Falsework. Forms for vertical surfaces may be removed after the concrete has \naged 12 hr. after initial set,  provided the removal can be executed without damage to the concrete, unless \notherwise directed. \nRemove forms for inside curb faces and for bridge rails whenever removal can be executed without damage \nto the curb or railing. \nLeave in place weight-supporting forms and falsework spanning more than 1 ft., except as directed \notherwise, until the concrete has attained a compressive strength of 2,500 psi. Remove forms for other \nstructural components as necessary. \nForms or parts of forms may be removed only if constructed to permit removal without disturbing forms or \nfalsework required to be left in place for a longer period on other portions of the structure. \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n556 \nRemove all metal appliances used inside forms for alignment to a depth of at least 1/2 in.    from the concrete \nsurface. Make the appliances so that metal may be removed without undue chipping or spalling of the \nconcrete, and so that it leaves a smooth opening in the concrete surface when removed. Do not burn off \nrods, bolts, or ties. \nRemove all forms and falsework unless otherwise directed. \nApply an ordinary surface finish as the final finish to the bottom of bridge slabs between girders or beams, \nand vertical and bottom surfaces of interior concrete beams or girders,  unless otherwise noted. \nForm marks and chamfer edges do not need to be smoothed for the bottom of bridge slabs between girders \nor beams. Remove all fins, runs, drips, or mortar from surfaces that will be exposed. \n4.10. Defective Work. The Contractor is responsible for the ride quality of the finished bridge slab. The Engineer \nwill use a 10-ft. straightedge (1/8 in.  in 10 ft.) to verify ride quality and determine locations where corrections \nare needed. Submit a plan for approval to produce a ride of acceptable quality if the Engineer determines the \nride quality is unacceptable. Make all corrections for ride before saw-cutting grooves. \nRepair defective work as soon as possible. Remove and replace at the expense of the Contractor any defect \nthat cannot be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer. \nThe Engineer will inspect the deck or slab for plastic shrinkage and settlement cracking after completion of \nfinal curing and within 5 days after curing mats are removed. Seal any noted shrinkage cracks attributable to \nContractor placing, curing, and finishing practices as well as transverse cracks over interior bents in \ncontinuous units using gravity feed crack repair as directed in accordance with Item 780, “Concrete Crack \nRepair,” at no cost to the Department.  \n4.11. Final Surface Texture. Saw-cut grooves in the hardened concrete of bridge slabs, bridge approach slabs, \nand direct traffic culverts to produce the final texturing after completion of the required curing period, unless \notherwise specified. Cut grooves parallel to the structure centerline, unless otherwise shown on plans. Cut \ngrooves along the slab within 18 in.  of the barrier rail, curb, or median divider. Adjust groove cutting at \nskewed metal expansion joints in bridge slabs so all grooves end within 6 in.    of the joint, measured \nperpendicular to the centerline of the metal joint. Leave no ungrooved surface wider than 6 in.    adjacent to \neither side of the joint. Cut grooves continuously across construction joints or other joints in the concrete less \nthan 1/2 in. wide. Apply the same procedure described above where barrier rails, curbs, or median dividers \nare not parallel to the structure centerline to maintain the 18-in.    maximum dimension from the end of the \ngrooves to the gutter line. Cut grooves continuously across formed concrete joints. Provide either a carpet \ndrag or broom finish for micro-texture when saw-cut grooves are not required on the plans. In this case, \nensure an adequate and consistent micro-texture is achieved by applying enough weight to the carpet and \nkeeping the carpet or broom from getting plugged with grout. For surfaces that do not have adequate texture, \nthe Engineer may require corrective action including diamond grinding or shot blasting. \nGive a carpet drag, burlap drag, or broom finish to all concrete surfaces to be overlaid when the plans call for \na concrete overlay (CO) to be placed on the slab (new construction). Saw-grooving is not required in this \ncase. Provide an average texture depth for the finish of approximately 0.035 in.    with no individual test falling \nbelow 0.020 in., unless otherwise shown on the plans, when tested in accordance with Tex-436-A\n. Revise \nfinishing procedures to produce the desired texture if the texture depth falls below what is intended. \nGive all concrete surfaces to be covered a lightly textured broom or carpet drag finish when the plans require \nan asphalt seal, with or without overlay, on the slab (new construction). Provide an average texture depth of \napproximately 0.025 in.    when tested in accordance with Tex-436-A\n. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nReinforced concrete slabs or decks on girders, beams, slab beams, double-T beams, or box beams placed \nunder this Item will be measured by the square foot of slab surface area using the nominal dimensions and \n\n2024 Specifications  422 \n557 \nconfiguration shown on the plans. Transverse measurement will be made from outer edge of slab to outer \nedge of slab (including raised median and sidewalk sections). Longitudinal measurement will be made \nbetween ends of units or spans. Diaphragms, haunch concrete, reinforcement, and optional steel \ndiaphragms will be considered as a portion of the slab unless otherwise shown on the plans. An estimated \nquantity for the haunch between the slab and beams will be included for the Contractor’s information only. No \nmeasurement will be made during construction for variation in the amount of haunch concrete due to \nvariations in camber of the beams. \nApproach slabs and cast-in-place superstructure elements including flat slabs, slab and girder units (pan \nformed), and shear keys will be measured by the cubic yard. For slab and girder spans using pan forms, a \nquantity will be included for the screed setting required to provide proper camber in the roadway surface after \nform removal. \nThis is a plans quantity measurement Item. The quantity to be paid is the quantity shown in the proposal, \nunless modified by Article 9.2., “Plans Quantity Measurement.” Additional measurements or calculations will \nbe made if adjustment of quantities is required. \nThe quantities of concrete and reinforcing steel shown on the plans are based on a conventionally formed \nslab. These quantities include amounts for concrete diaphragms, brackets and other required attachments, \nand haunch concrete when required, based on the profile grade, theoretical camber, and dead load \ndeflection of the beams. No additional measurement will be made for concrete or reinforcing steel due to a \nvariation in camber of the beams from theoretical camber, or for additional quantities required by optional \nmethods of forming. \nAdditional concrete that may be required by an adjustment of the profile grade line during construction, to \nensure proper slab thickness, will not be measured for payment. \n6.

Permanent MSE Walls. Grade the foundation for the structure level to a width equal to or exceeding the \nlength of the reinforcing system. Perform proof rolling on retaining wall foundation area to identify any loose, \nsoft, or unsuitable materials in accordance with Item 216, “Proof Rolling.” Material not meeting a maximum \nrut depth of 1 in.    per pass of pneumatic tire roller should continue to be rolled or removed and replaced with \nsuitable material. Pneumatic tire rolling will be waived for portions of wall with a reinforcement length of 8 ft.; \nfor these conditions, proof rolling will be required using a smooth-wheeled vibratory roller or other approved \nroller. \nPlace drilled shafts and piling located within the MSE volume before construction of the wall. Place any \nrequired pipe underdrain before construction of the wall. Complete MSE wall construction before construction \nof abutment caps and abutment wing walls. Completion of walls and abutment should be in conjunction with \nproject phasing or allow for completion of walls that meets the proper placement and compaction at \nabutments. \nPlace the concrete leveling pad as shown on the construction drawings. Provide a wood float finish and wait \nat least 24 hr. before beginning panel erection. No curing or strength testing of the leveling pad concrete is \nrequired. \nShim the first row of panels as necessary to achieve correct alignment. Use plastic shims or other material \nthat will not deteriorate. Remove and replace the leveling pad or provide a grout level-up as directed if the \nrequired shim height exceeds 1 in.    \nPlace filter fabric behind the wall along the joint between the leveling pad and the panels. Grout areas where \nfilter fabric spans more than 6 in.    at leveling pad steps. \nPlace and compact fill material over the leveling pad to an elevation even with or above the surrounding \nground after backfilling the first row of panels. Do not allow water to accumulate and stand at the base of the \nwall. \nPlace filter fabric behind all wall joints and at the intersection of retaining walls with other structures, including \nriprap. Cover joints at least 6 in.    on each side and use adhesive to hold the filter fabric in place. \nExercise care while lifting, setting, and aligning panels to prevent damage to the panels. Discontinue any \noperation that results in chipping, spalling, or cracking of panels. Remove and replace damaged panels, or \nrepair as approved. \nProvide external bracing for the initial row of panels. Use wooden wedges, clamps, or other means \nnecessary to maintain position and stability of panels during placement and compaction of backfill. Remove \nwooden wedges as soon as the panel or coping above the wedged element is erected and backfilled. \nRemove all wedges after completing the wall. \nReview plumbness and position of each row of panels before placing the subsequent row. Remove and \nrebuild any portion of the wall that is out of tolerance. Modify panel batter and bracing, and backfill material, \nplacement, and compaction methods as required to maintain wall tolerances. \nConstruct walls to a local vertical and horizontal alignment tolerance of 3/4 in.    when measured along a 10-ft. \nstraightedge relative to vertical and horizontal wall control line. Construct walls to an overall vertical tolerance \n(plumbness from top to bottom) of 1/2 in.    per 10 ft. of wall height. Construct walls so the maximum offset at \nany panel joint is between 3/8 in.    and 3/4 in.    and no joint is open to the extent the filter fabric is visible from \nthe front of the wall. \nPlace backfill to closely follow the erection of each row of panels. Place the select and embankment backfill \nto the same elevation where possible, and operate the compaction equipment over the interface. Do not \n\n2024 Specifications  423 \n563 \ncreate a continuous, distinct, vertical joint between the select and embankment backfill. Complete the \nembankment after construction of the retaining wall. \nMaintain the stability of the interface area between the existing ground and the select fill when building a wall \nagainst existing ground. Remove and recompact any material that loosens, caves, or fails. \nCompact backfill to provide at least 95% of density determined in accordance with Tex-114-E\n. Field density \ndetermination will be made in accordance with Tex-115-E. \nSprinkle backfill as required to ensure adequate uniformly distributed moisture in each lift before and during \ncompaction. Place fill in lifts of 8 in.  or less (loose measurement). Place fill in a manner that avoids \nsegregation of the fill. Decrease the lift thickness if necessary to obtain the required compaction. Use \nhand-operated or walk-behind compaction equipment in the 3-ft. wide strip adjacent to the wall panels. Do \nnot displace panels or distort or damage the reinforcement system during compaction. Modify backfill \nmaterial, placement, and compaction methods as necessary to meet density requirements while maintaining \nwall tolerances. \nPlace rock backfill or material the Engineer determines too coarse for density testing in accordance with \nSection 132.3.4.1., “Ordinary Compaction.” \nPlace and compact the backfill to the reinforcement level, at each earth reinforcement level, before placing \nthe reinforcement. Place earth reinforcements perpendicular to the face of the wall. Remove slack in \nconnections before placing backfill. Pre-tension each layer of reinforcement to remove slack before placing \nbackfill for systems using nonmetallic earth reinforcements. Use devices capable of mechanically applying \nand holding the required force. Do not operate tracked equipment directly on any reinforcement. \nCover the rock backfill with filter fabric before placing the 2 ft. of backfill immediately below the pavement \nstructure or top of wall when rock backfill is used. Overlap the fabric at least 18 in. at splices, and extend it \npast the edge of the rock backfill at least 18 in. Use backfill that contains sufficient fines to fill the voids in a \ncompacted state above the filter fabric. Place a horizontal layer of filter fabric as specified above when \ntransitioning from rock backfill to finer grained backfill anywhere within the wall volume. \nPrevent surface water or rainwater from damaging the retaining walls during construction. Shape the backfill \nto prevent water from ponding or flowing on the backfill or against the wall face. Remove and replace any \nportion of the retaining wall damaged or moved out of tolerance by erosion, sloughing, or saturation of the \nretaining wall or embankment backfill. \n3.5. Temporary MSE Walls. Provide a facing system rigid enough to maintain a smooth and straight wall face \nboth during and after construction. \nGrade and compact the foundation for the structure in accordance with Section 423.3.4., “Permanent MSE \nWalls.” \nPlace earth reinforcement and facing system as shown on the approved working drawings. Backfill the 2-ft. \nzone immediately behind the facing with clean, coarse rock meeting the requirements of Coarse Aggregate \nGrade 1, 2, or 3 of Item 421, or with Type DS backfill as described in Section 423.2.4.2., “Select.” \nCement-stabilized backfill as described in Section 423.2.4.4., “Cement-Stabilized Backfill,”   or crushed \nconcrete may be used in place of the coarse rock. \nPlace and compact backfill in accordance with Section 423.3.4., “Permanent MSE Walls.” \nConstruct walls to a vertical and horizontal alignment tolerance of 3 in. when measured along a 10-ft. \nstraightedge. Construct walls to an overall vertical tolerance (plumbness from top to bottom) of 2 in. per 10 ft. \nof wall height. Place adjacent facing elements so the maximum out-of-plane offset at any facing element joint \nis less than 1 in. Place facing elements and filter fabric with no gaps in the facing or fabric. \n\n2024 Specifications  423 \n564 \nPrevent surface water or rainwater from damaging the retaining walls during and after construction. Place \ntemporary berms or curbs, shape the backfill, or use other approved methods to prevent water from flowing \nagainst or over the wall face. Remove and replace any portion of the wall damaged or moved out of \ntolerance by erosion, sloughing, or saturation of the retaining wall or embankment backfill. \n3.6. Concrete Block Retaining Walls. The concrete block units may be sampled and tested by the Engineer \nbefore shipment or upon delivery to the construction site.

Personnel Qualifications. Provide qualified personnel in accordance with DMS-7300\n for each particular \nplant operation. \n4.1.5. Quality Responsibilities. The quality responsibilities for the Contractor for each particular plant operation \nwill be in accordance with DMS-7300\n. \n4.2. Fabrication. Prepare a casting schedule on Department-approved forms in accordance with DMS-7300, and \nsubmit it daily to the Department before fabrication. This requirement does not apply to project-specific minor \nprestressed member or project-specific nonstressed member fabrication plants. Perform fabrication during \ndaylight hours unless the production site has an approved lighting system. Submit lighting details \nelectronically to the Engineer for review before installing lighting system. Allow for plant and Department \ninspection in accordance with Item 6, “Control of Materials.” \n4.2.1. Forms. Design forms to prevent damage to the concrete from restraint as the concrete shrinks, from form \nexpansion and contraction from thermal changes, from stripping operations, and from dimensional changes \ndue to pre-tensioning. Forms, regardless of material, must conform to the profiles, dimensions, and \ntolerances of the finished product as shown on the plans and in accordance with this Item. Maintain forms \nfree of dents, grease, or other foreign materials that may affect the appearance of the member, and clean \nforms thoroughly before each casting operation and immediately before applying a form-release agent. \n4.2.1.1. External Forms. Construct side and bottom forms of steel unless otherwise approved or shown on the \nplans. Timber forms, when permitted, must meet the requirements of Section 420.4.4., “Forms.” End headers \nmay be of other material as approved. \nConstruct forms with sufficient thickness, external bracing and stiffeners, and anchorage to withstand the \nforces generated during concrete placement and consolidation. Do not stabilize forms with bracing and \nholding devices that will remain in the finished member. \nProvide corners with a chamfer or radius as shown on the plans. \nMaintain forms sufficiently mortar-tight to prevent damage that requires repair to the finished product. Where \nsections of forms will be joined, an offset of 1/16 in. for flat surfaces and 1/8 in. for corners and bends is \npermitted. Longitudinal form joints in prestressed concrete beams are not permitted except for the side forms \nof slab beams, decked slab beams, box beams, and X-beams,  or as shown on the plans. Do not allow \nvertical or horizontal gaps or offsets to exceed 1/4 in. between adjacent sections of built-up end headers. \nCheck and maintain the grade and alignment of forms each time they are set and during placement of \nconcrete. \nApply a form-release agent, in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, to the facing of forms \nbefore placing concrete. Use a form-release agent that facilitates form removal and does not affect any \nrequired coating, painting, or color-staining operations. Do not use materials that appreciably stain or react \nwith the concrete. Remove excess form-release agent from the form surface before casting, and ensure it \ndoes not contaminate strands, reinforcing steel, and embedments. Use a clear form-release agent of the \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n569 \nsame brand throughout the casting of retaining wall panels per structure, unless it can be shown that a \ndifferent form-release agent does not change the appearance of the concrete. \nConstruct the forms to facilitate removal of members without damage to the concrete. \nConstruct and maintain the soffit (liner) to provide a maximum 1/4-in. variation from the theoretical plane, and \ndo not allow the soffit to vary more than 1/4 in. between any two points in any 50-ft. length. \nAt the Contractor’s option, construct side forms for bridge deck panels and prestressed piling with a draft for \nease of product removal. Maintain product dimensional tolerances shown in Table 3. A maximum 1/4-in. draft \nis allowed for bridge deck panels. \n4.2.1.2. Internal Forms. Use solid expanded polystyrene conforming to ASTM C578, Type I for forming internal \nvoids. The form material must be inert, non-biodegradable, non-absorptive, and strong enough to maintain \nsufficient rigidity to withstand the forces generated during concrete placement and consolidation without \ndamage. Other materials for forming internal voids may be used when approved. Provide certification of \nconformance for void forms. The Engineer may require samples to be submitted when needed. \nAnchor internal void forms to prevent movement or misalignment while placing concrete. Provide hold-down \ndevices for all types of void forms at 30-in. maximum spacing unless otherwise approved. Do not use internal \nhold-down or lateral bracing devices that will remain in the finished member unless approved. Provide \nenough bearing area on the void form to prevent penetration of hold-down devices into the void form. Splice \nvoid form sections to prevent separation or misalignment during concrete placement and consolidation \noperations. \nDuring casting, verify and document void form placement at 10-ft. maximum spacing using an approved \nmethod. \nDrain prestressed concrete U-beams and voided box beams through the bottom flange by forming holes in \neach voided area as shown on the plans. \n4.2.2. Prestressing. Perform pre-tensioning in accordance with this Item and post-tensioning in accordance with \nItem 426. \n4.2.2.1. Prestressing Equipment. Furnish hydraulic jacks with sufficient capacity for prestressing the steel. Equip \nthe jacks with instruments for monitoring the hydraulic pressure. Provide gauges at least 6 in. in diameter \nand with means to prevent the gauge pointer from fluctuating. Electronic pressure transducers with digital \nindicators may be used. Pressure gauges or electronic pressure indicators must indicate the load directly to \n1% of the maximum gauge or sensor/indicator capacity, or 2% of the maximum load applied, whichever is \nsmaller. \nCalibrate each jack and its gauge with the cylinder extension in the approximate position at final jacking \nforce. Jacks and gauges for post-tensioning and single-strand pre-tensioning must be calibrated as a unit. \nHave certified calibration charts furnished by an independent laboratory and with each jack and gauge used \non the project. Provide certified calibration of each ram before starting stressing operations on the project \nand: \n every 6 mo. thereafter for post-tensioning operations, \n every 12 mo. thereafter for pre-tensioning operations, and \n as requested. \nThe calibration frequency for multiple-strand pre-tensioning equipment may be extended to every 24 mo. \nthereafter if an approved master gauge system monitors it. The master gauge must check this equipment \nwhen suspect results occur and at least every 6 mo. Calibrate the master gauge in conformance with the \nmanufacturer’s recommendations and at least every 12 mo. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n570 \nRecalibrate jacks and gauges when a malfunction occurs;  when repairs such as replacing the seals, \nchanging the length of the hydraulic lines, or changing the pump occur;  or when using gauges that have not \nbeen calibrated with the jack. Extra compensation will not be allowed for the initial or subsequent \ncalibrations. \nPost-tensioning jacks must have provisions for measuring tendon elongation directly on the strand or bar. \nThe jacks must be capable of slow release of force to properly seat the tendon anchors. \nSingle-strand stressing jacks for pre-tensioning must have provisions for measuring the elongation directly on \nthe strand. \nMulti-strand detensioning jacks must have sufficient capacity and throw to permit simultaneous release of the \nentire load in the strands. Use an approved single-strand flame-release procedure to release the remaining \nload if there is not enough throw in the multi-strand jacks to release all load in the strands. \n4.2.2.2. Pre-Tensioning. Pre-tension all strands to a uniform initial load between 5% and 25% of the final load, \nunless otherwise approved. Apply the load within a tolerance of: \n ±100 lb. per strand if the designated initial load is less than or equal to 10% of the final load, or \n ±200 lb. per strand if the designated initial load is greater than 10% of the final load. \nMeasure the initial load with a calibrated dynamometer or other suitable instrument. \nDo not allow the modulus of elasticity of individual strands to vary more than 1% from each other when \nmultiple-strand tensioned. Use a weighted average modulus of elasticity of strands to calculate elongation for \nmultiple-strand tensioning operations. \nEstablish reference marks on the strand for measuring elongation after initial tensioning. Provide means for \nmeasuring the elongation of the strand to an accuracy of 1% of the theoretical elongation or 1/8 in., \nwhichever is smaller. Establish independent references on the strand adjacent to each anchorage, to indicate \nslippage that may occur between the time of initial stressing and final release of the strands. \nDo not allow the stress in the strand to exceed 80% of the specified ultimate tensile strength of the strand at \nany time. \nDo not use any portion of the strand that has been previously gripped with chucks in the length of strand to \nbe tensioned, except where gripped with chucks during initial tensioning. Do not drive over prestressing \nstrand. \nStrand chucks designed with spring caps must be used with the spring caps. Visually inspect strand chucks \nthat are not equipped with spring caps to ensure all wedges are evenly seated after applying initial load. \nCorrect unevenly seated wedges by releasing the stress, repositioning wedges, and reapplying the initial \nload. \nFailure of individual wires in a seven-wire strand is acceptable if the total area of wire failure is not more than \n2% of the total cross-sectional area of all strands in the member, and if no more than one wire fails in any \nsingle strand. Any setup with one or more broken wires must be examined by a licensed professional \nengineer or Quality Control Supervisor (as defined in DMS-7300\n)  to determine the cause before continuing \nstressing operations on the particular casting line. \n4.2.2.2.1. Strand Splicing. Do not splice draped strands. One splice per straight strand will be permitted subject to the \nfollowing. \n Locate splices outside the members. \n Splice strands with the lay or twist in the same direction to avoid unraveling. \n Splice all straight strands in a multiple-strand tensioning operation so an adjustment can be made for \nthe average seating loss. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n571 \n Cut strand ends to be spliced with shears, abrasive saws, or grinders to remove regions where chucks \nwere previously seated. Cut in the same manner at least 12 in. from strand ends to be spliced that were \npreviously flame cut. \n4.2.2.2.2. Single and Multiple Straight Strand Tensioning.  After initial tensioning, apply the required load to the \nstrands as shown on the plans by means of single-strand or multiple-strand hydraulic jacks equipped with \ncalibrated gauges. Verify the final load in the strands by observing either the gauge pressure or elongation \nand independently checking the other. The final load and elongation must agree within 5% of the computed \ntheoretical values. Additionally, the final load and elongation must agree algebraically with each other within \n5%. Suspend tensioning operations until the problem has been identified and corrected in the event of \ndiscrepancies exceeding these tolerances. \nVerify uniform application of load to strands for multiple s\ntrand-tensioning systems by measuring the \nmovement on opposite sides of the anchorage. \n4.2.2.2.3. Draped Strand Tensioning. Verify the intermediate load by observing either the gauge pressure or \nelongation and independently checking the other when draped strands are tensioned in a straight or partially \ndraped position before application of final load. If strands are tensioned in the final position, intermediate or \nfinal load and elongation must agree within 5% of the computed theoretical values. Additionally, the \nintermediate or final load and elongation must agree algebraically within 5% of each other. Suspend \ntensioning operations until the problem has been identified and corrected in the event of discrepancies \nexceeding these tolerances. \nAfter application of final load, measurements on individual draped strands to establish differential stresses at \ns\nelected points on the member will be averaged at a cross-section of the member. The averages must be \nwithin 5% of the theoretical elongation. The measured elongation of any individual draped strand must not \nvary from the theoretical elongation by more than 10% at any measured cross-section. Suspend tensioning \noperations until the problem has been identified and corrected in the event of discrepancies exceeding these \ntolerances. \nOther methods to measure the intermediate load and final load in the draped strands may be submitted for \napproval. \n4.2.2.2.4. Strand Debonding. Encase strands in plastic sheathing along the entire debonded length, when shown on \nthe plans, and seal the ends with waterproof tape. Use split plastic sheathing only if the seam is sufficiently \nsealed with waterproof tape to prohibit grout infiltration. Use sheathing that will not react with the surrounding \nconcrete. \nFull-l\nength debonding of straight strands will be approved on an individual basis. Full-length debonding, \nwhen permitted, must be symmetrical about the vertical centerline of the beam and limited to 10% of the total \nnumber of straight strands or six straight strands, whichever is less. Do not debond draped strands full \nlength. When using a concrete anchor block to combine strand patterns,  the same criteria apply. \n4.2.2.3. Combined Pre-Tensioning and Post-Tensioning. When the plans call for a combination of pre-tensioning \nand post-tensioning, all the requirements for pre-tensioning in this specification and for post-tensioning in \nItem 426 apply. \n4.2.3. Placing Reinforcing Steel. Place reinforcing steel in accordance with Item 440, “Reinforcement for \nConcrete.” Reinforcing steel projection outside the member must not be more than 1/2 in. or less than 3/4 in. \nfrom plan dimension unless otherwise approved. Do not damage sheathing for strand debonding. Do not tie \nreinforcing steel to debonded strand regions. \nWeld steel components in accordance with Item 441, “Steel Structures.”    \n4.2.4. Quality of Concrete. Provide concrete in accordance with Item 421, “Hydraulic Cement Concrete.” Use the \nclass of concrete shown on the plans or in the pertinent Item for each type of structure or unit. Provide \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n572 \nconcrete meeting the approved mix design water-cement ratio. SCC is not allowed for project-specific \nfabrication plants unless approved. Mix concrete for 1 min. for 1 cu. yd. and 15 sec. for each additional cubic \nyard of rated capacity of the mixer. Count the mixing time from the time all materials are in the drum. \nIncrease mixing time if necessary to achieve a uniform mix. Control concrete by compressive strength tests \nof cylinders or other pertinent performance tests detailed on the plans or pertinent Items. Concrete \ncompressive-strength test cylinders will be made, cured, and tested in accordance with Tex-704-I\n. Cure \nrelease-  of-tension strength cylinders in accordance with Tex-715-I when match-cure technology is used. \nHigh-strength concrete (f ́\nc\n > 9,000 psi) is accepted based on 56-day compressive strength testing. Concrete \ndesign-strength test cylinders for high-strength concrete will be made, cured, and tested in accordance with \nTex-704-I\n. \nProduct with concrete that fails to meet minimum design compressive strength requirements will be \nreviewed. Concrete that has been determined to be structurally adequate may be accepted at an adjusted \nprice based on the formula in Article 421.6., “Measurement and Payment.” If the Engineer requires cores be \ntaken to determine the strength of the in-situ concrete, the coring will be at the Contractor’s expense and in \naccordance with Tex-424-A\n. All cores from precast members must meet 100% of the minimum design \ncompressive strength requirements. For concrete that has been determined to be structurally adequate, \ncoring of the in-situ concrete will not be allowed for the purpose of avoiding the price adjustment. The \nDepartment may require reimbursement for testing of cores. Testing by an approved commercial testing \nlaboratory will be at the Contractor’s expense. Test results from a commercial laboratory must be sealed by a \nlicensed professional engineer. \nSCC used for prestressed beams must have a Modulus of Elasticity of 5,000 ksi at 28 days. Test the \nconcrete mix design before use in accordance with ASTM C469. \n4.2.5. Placing Concrete. Place concrete only when its temperature at time of placement is between 50°F and \n95°F. \nTake responsibility for producing quality concrete under any weather condition and ensure adequate weather \nprotection provisions are on-site and available for immediate use. \nProvide immediate protective measures without compromising the quality of the product if rainfall occurs after \nconcrete placing operations have started. Failure to immediately provide adequate weather protection may \nbe cause for rejection of the affected product. \nMaintain concrete transporting equipment clean and free of hardened concrete. \nAt the time of concrete placement, reinforcing steel, strands, and embedments must be free of dirt, oil, or \nother bond-breaking substances. \nPlace and adequately consolidate concrete while all lifts are in a plastic state. Concrete must not exhibit \nsegregation or excessive bleeding. Minimize concrete flow lines and displacement of the reinforcing steel, \nstrands, embedments, and ducts during concrete placement. Place concrete as near as possible to its final \nposition in the forms,  except when using SCC. Do not deposit large quantities of concrete at one location and \nrun or work it along the forms to other locations,  except for SCC. Place SCC in a manner to avoid \nsegregation. \nDo not allow fresh concrete to free-fall more than 8 ft. unless approved. \nWork the coarse aggregate back from the face of the concrete and force the concrete under and around the \nreinforcing steel, strands, embedments, and ducts. If prestressed concrete I-beams are cast in multiple lifts, \nthe thickness of the first lift must be slightly above the juncture of the bottom flange and web. \nUnless otherwise approved by the Engineer, cast prestressed concrete voided box beams monolithically in \ntwo stages, maintaining the concrete in the previously placed bottom slab in a plastic state until the web (side \nwall) concrete is placed and vibrated into the bottom slab. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n573 \nThe maximum time between the addition of mixing water or cement to the concrete batch and the placing of \nconcrete in the forms is 30 min. for concrete delivered in non-agitated delivery equipment and 60 min. for \nconcrete delivered in agitated delivery equipment. If conditions of wind, humidity, and temperature cause \nquick stiffening of the concrete, the required placement times may be reduced and an approved retarder may \nbe required, or increased if currently in use. Submit a plan for approval, if necessary, to demonstrate the \nconcrete can be properly placed, consolidated, and finished without reducing placement time limits. \nThe maximum acceptable placement slump will be in accordance with Item 421, unless otherwise specified. \nWhen the maximum acceptable placement slump or slump flow is exceeded, the affected concrete will be \nrejected, and retesting for slump or slump flow will not be allowed, regardless of the concrete placement \ntimes. \nAdditional requirements for precast mass placements will be in accordance with Item 420, “Concrete \nSubstructures.” In the case of a conflict between the two Items, the more stringent requirements apply. \n4.2.5.1. Placing Concrete in Cold Weather. Maintain concrete temperature between 50 and 95°F at time of \nplacement in accordance with Section 424.4.2.5., “Placing Concrete,” and maintain the concrete temperature \nof precast members at or above 50°F during the specified curing period in accordance with \nSection 424.4.2.7., “Curing of Concrete.” Do not place concrete when the atmospheric temperature in the \nshade is below 40°F and falling, unless approved. Concrete may be placed when the atmospheric \ntemperature in the shade is at least 35°F and rising or above 40°F, provided adequate cold-weather \nprotection provisions are on-site and available for immediate use before placing concrete when weather \nconditions indicate a possible need for temperature protection. When required, provide necessary covering \nmaterial or an approved accelerated curing system in accordance with Section 424.4.2.7.4., “Accelerated \nCuring,” and do not allow any concrete to remain unprotected for longer than 1 hr. after placement. Do not \nplace concrete in contact with any material coated with frost or with material at a temperature of 32°F or \nlower. Do not apply heat directly to concrete surfaces if accelerated curing is used. Take protective measures \nto ensure the difference between air temperature and concrete surface temperature does not cause thermal \ncracking. \nMaintain aggregates free of ice, frost, and frozen lumps. Heat the aggregate and the water when needed to \nproduce the minimum concrete placement temperature of 50°F, but: \n do not allow the water temperature to exceed 180°F or the aggregate temperature to exceed 150°F, \n heat the aggregate uniformly to eliminate overheated areas in the stockpile that might cause flash set of \nthe cement, and \n provide an aggregate and water mixture temperature between 50 and 85°F before introduction of the \ncement. \n4.2.5.2. Placing Concrete in Hot Weather. Keep concrete at or below 95°F at time of placement in accordance with \nSection 424.4.2.5., “Placing Concrete.” Use any of the following methods, as needed, to control the concrete \nplacement temperature. \n Cool the aggregate by sprinkling or fogging (fine mist) with water, shading, or using an approved liquid \nnitrogen system and procedure. \n Cool the fresh concrete by using chilled mixing water, partially replacing mixing water with shaved or \ncrushed ice, or using an approved system and procedure to discharge liquid nitrogen into concrete \nduring batching. \nApply a fog spray (fine mist) of water to the steel just before placing concrete when the temperature of steel \nforms, strand, or reinforcing steel is greater than 120°F. Water droplets left on the form surfaces must not \nadversely affect surface finishes. \nWhen field conditions are such that evaporation of water from the concrete makes the surface finishing \noperation difficult, a fog spray (fine mist) of water may be applied above the concrete surface. Do not fog \ndirectly toward the concrete or in any manner that will wash cement paste from the fresh concrete surface or \ncause water to puddle. Do not use fog to add finishing water and do not work moisture from the fog spray \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n574 \ninto the fresh concrete. An approved evaporation retardant conforming to DMS-4650\n, “Hydraulic Cement \nConcrete Curing Materials and Evaporation Retardants,” is also acceptable if used in conformance with the \nmanufacturer’s recommendations. Do not apply the evaporation retardant when floating and troweling \nconcrete. Do not allow it to puddle or be worked into the concrete surface immediately after application. \nMisuse of fog spray or evaporation retardant will be cause for disallowing its use. Shade the concrete during \ncasting if necessary. \nUse an approved retarder, in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, when the air \ntemperature is above 85°F if necessary to control concrete slump loss and lengthen the time for placing, \nconsolidating, and finishing operations. \n4.2.5.3. Consolidation of Concrete. Consolidate concrete thoroughly using high-frequency vibration immediately \nafter placement. For prestressed concrete beams and piling, internal vibration is required and may be \nsupplemented with external vibration. \nProvide at least one on-site standby vibrator of the type being used for emergency use. \nPerform concrete vibration using trained personnel and proper timing and spacing to ensure adequate \nconsolidation. Revise the concrete placement and consolidation procedures, and review the concrete mix \ndesign and batching procedures, if necessary, when unacceptable defects such as excessive honeycombing, \naggregate or mortar pockets,  or surface air voids (bugholes) are present. Provide supplemental vibrators or \nmodify the vibration system when required to accomplish thorough consolidation of the concrete and \ncomplete embedment of the strands, reinforcing steel, embedments, or ducts. Avoid segregation or \nexcessive bleeding of the concrete during vibration. \n4.2.5.3.1. Internal Vibration. Insert vibrators into the concrete immediately after concrete placement at points spaced \nto ensure uniform vibration of the entire concrete mass. Limit the insertion spacing to within the radius where \nthe vibrators are visibly effective. Allow the vibrators to sink into the concrete by their own weight and \npenetrate previously placed lifts that are still in a plastic state to thoroughly consolidate the layers together \nand prevent cold joints. Withdraw the vibrators slowly to avoid forming holes after the concrete is thoroughly \nconsolidated. \nDo not allow prolonged contact of vibrators with forms so vibrator marks on concrete surfaces are minimal. \nDo not use vibrators to move concrete to other locations in the forms. \nUse vibrators with nonmetallic vibrating heads to prevent damage to the epoxy coating when epoxy coated \nreinforcing steel is used. Increase the consolidation time and decrease the insertion spacing, if necessary, \nwhen using these vibrators. \n4.2.5.3.2. External Vibration. \n4.2.5.3.2.1. Form Vibrators. Form vibrators may be used to consolidate thin members, supplement internal vibration, or \nconsolidate members with highly congested reinforcing steel. \nDetermine the size, number, and location of external vibrators to provide enough intensity of vibration to the \ndesired area of the form. Adjust the spacing, frequency, amplitude, and duration of vibration according to the \nconcrete mix and size of member to produce uniform consolidation of the concrete. \n4.2.5.3.2.2. Surface Vibrators. Use vibratory screeds to consolidate thin sections. Move vibratory screeds at a rate that \nwill bring enough mortar to the surface to embed and cover the coarse aggregate. Do not over-vibrate by \ncausing an excessive amount of mortar to be brought to the surface. \n4.2.5.3.2.3. Vibrating Tables. Determine the size, number, and location of external vibrators to provide enough intensity \nof vibration to the desired area of the form. Adjust the spacing, frequency, amplitude, and duration of \nvibration according to the concrete mix and size of member to produce uniform consolidation of the concrete. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n575 \n4.2.5.3.3. Vibration of Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC). Vibrate SCC only when approved. Provide an adequate \namount of viscosity modifying admixture (VMA) in SCC mix when internal vibration is allowed. \n4.2.6. Finishing of Concrete. Finished, unformed surfaces must not have distortions greater than 1/4 in. Screed or \nrough-float unformed surfaces of members, bringing enough mortar to the surface to embed and cover the \ncoarse aggregate. Provide a uniform rough wood float finish to the surface of the member unless otherwise \nshown on the plans. Do not loosen aggregate when roughening the surface using a broom or when providing \na tine finish. \nProvide a smooth metal trowel finish for surfaces at anchor bolt locations. \n4.2.7. Curing of Concrete. Cure concrete to promote early cement hydration by providing adequate moisture on \nexposed surfaces and by maintaining the concrete temperature or curing enclosure air temperature at the \nconcrete surface within the limits specified in this Section. Provide uniform temperature and moisture on the \nsurfaces to prevent differential shrinkage that may cause warping or cracking. Prevent temperature \ndifferentials within the concrete that cause thermal cracking. \nBegin curing after the finishing operation, before the formation of plastic shrinkage cracks, and as soon as \ndamage to the surface finish will not occur. Provide fog spray or an evaporation retardant after finishing and \nbefore curing if needed to prevent plastic shrinkage cracks. Apply fog spray or evaporation retardant in \naccordance with Section 424.4.2.5.2., “Placing Concrete in Hot Weather.” Keep exposed concrete surfaces \ncontinuously wet for the duration of the specified curing period, unless an approved liquid membrane-forming \ncuring compound is used. Membrane curing compound is permitted only in    accordance with this Section or in \nconformance with the pertinent Item. \nApproved equipment and materials for curing must be on-site and available for immediate use before placing \nconcrete. Provide temperature probes to monitor the concrete temperature or curing enclosure air \ntemperature as specified in Table 2. \nTable 2 \nTemperature Probe Requirements \nCondition Major Prestressed Members Minor Prestressed Members Nonstressed Members \nForecasted atmospheric \ntemperature ≥50°F \nduring specified curing \nperiod \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor high \nconcrete temperature regions\n5\n \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor high \nconcrete temperature regions\n1,5\n \nN/A \nForecasted atmospheric \ntemperature <50°F \nduring specified curing \nperiod \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor high \nconcrete temperature regions,\n5\n \nand \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor low \nconcrete temperature regions\n2,5\n \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor high \nconcrete temperature regions,\n1,5\n \nand \n2 concrete temperature probes per \ncasting line to monitor low \nconcrete temperature regions\n2,5\n \n1 concrete temperature \nprobe per 100 cu. yd. of \nconcrete or fraction \nthereof to monitor low \nconcrete temperature \nregions\n2\n \nForecasted atmospheric \ntemperature <40°F \nduring additional 3-day \ncuring period\n3\n \nN/A \n1 concrete temperature probe per \nsimilar curing condition for \nprestressed piling only \nN/A \nWhen accelerated curing \nis used \n2 temperature probes per casting \nline to monitor curing enclosure air \ntemperature at concrete \nsurfaces\n4,5\n \n2 temperature probes per casting \nline to monitor curing enclosure air \ntemperature at concrete \nsurfaces\n4,5\n \n1 temperature probe per \n100 cu. yd. of concrete or \nfraction thereof to monitor \ncuring enclosure air \ntemperature at concrete \nsurfaces \n1. Excluding prestressed bridge deck panels and prestressed retaining wall panels. \n2. When accelerated curing is used, concrete temperature probes to monitor low concrete temperature regions are not \nrequired. \n3. After attaining specified release-of-tension strength. \n4. These probes are in addition to the concrete temperature probes required for monitoring high concrete temperature \nregions. \n5. Place probes at the beginning and end of casting line. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n576 \nAttach each temperature probe to a separate temperature recording device unless multi-channel temperature \nrecording devices are used, in which case one high concrete temperature probe and one low concrete \ntemperature probe may be attached to the same recording device. When accelerated curing is used, \none curing enclosure air temperature probe may also be attached to this multi-channel temperature recording \ndevice. \nInadequate curing facilities or lack of attention to the proper curing of concrete will be cause for the Engineer \nto stop concrete placement until approved curing is provided. Inadequate curing may be cause for rejection \nof the affected product. \nForms may be removed at the discretion of the Contractor at any time after the concrete has reached \nsufficient strength to prevent physical damage to the member. Do not interrupt curing for more than 60 min. \nduring form removal. \nThe following curing requirements apply for prestressed members. \n Cure concrete continuously, except as allowed during form removal, until the compressive strength of \nthe concrete has reached the specified release-of-tension strength and until detensioning has been \nperformed. \n Maintain concrete temperatures between 50 and 150°F during the curing period. The maximum \nallowable concrete temperature may be increased to 170°F if the Contractor uses one of the concrete \nmix design options listed in Section 421.4.2.6., “Mix Design Options,” other than Options 6, 7, and 8. \nThe Engineer may require lowering of the total cementitious content in the concrete mix design to the \nlimits specified in Item 421 for repeated violations of the maximum curing temperature. \n Membrane curing is permitted only for unformed surfaces of prestressed wall panels and interim curing \non unformed surfaces of prestressed piling. Use Type 1-D or Type 2 curing compound in accordance \nwith DMS-4650\n for this application. \n Water cure prestressed piling an additional 3 days after attaining the specified release-of-tension \nstrength. Do not interrupt curing for more than 4 hr. when moving piling to the storage area. Maintain the \nconcrete temperature of piling at 50°F or above during this additional curing period. \nThe following curing requirements apply for nonstressed members. \n Cure concrete continuously, except as allowed during form removal, for 4 days or until the compressive \nstrength of the concrete has reached the design strength. \n Maintain concrete temperatures between 50°F and 150°F during the curing period. The maximum \nallowable concrete temperature may be increased to 170°F if the Contractor uses one of the concrete \nmix design options listed in Section 421.4.2.6., “Mix Design Options,” other than Options 6, 7, and 8. \n Membrane curing is permitted on nonstressed members, except for surfaces to be painted or color \nstained. \nCure members for an additional 24 hr. beginning immediately after the normal curing period if they are out of \ncure at any time other than during the allowable 60 min. for form removal or during the allowable 4 hr. for \nmoving piling to storage. \nMembers failing to meet the concrete temperature requirements or curing enclosure air temperature \nrequirements during curing will be reviewed. Repeated failure to maintain proper concrete temperatures may \nbe cause for rejection of the affected product. \n4.2.7.1. Water Curing. Water curing provides additional moisture to concrete and prevents moisture loss. Water \nused for curing must meet the requirements for concrete mixing and curing water specified in \nSection 421.2.5., “Water.” Do not use seawater or water that stains or leaves an unsightly residue that \ncannot be removed. Monitor and maintain a temperature differential between curing water and concrete \nsurface temperature that prevents thermal cracking. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n577 \n4.2.7.1.1. Wet Mat Method. Use water-saturated cotton mats, burlap-polyethylene sheeting, or other approved \nmoisture-retaining materials. Anchor the wet mats adequately to provide continuous contact with exposed \nconcrete surfaces. \n4.2.7.1.2. Water Spray Method. Use overlapping sprays,  sprinklers, or soil-soaker hoses so concrete surfaces are \nkept continuously wet. \n4.2.7.1.3. Ponding Method. Continuously cover exposed concrete surfaces with standing water. \n4.2.7.2. Moisture Retention Curing. Moisture retention curing prevents moisture loss from the concrete. \n4.2.7.2.1. Form Curing Method. Concrete surfaces in direct contact with forms that are left in place will not require \nadditional curing methods unless cold-weather protection is necessary. \n4.2.7.2.2. Impermeable Cover Method. Cover exposed concrete surfaces with polyethylene sheeting, burlap-\npolyethylene sheeting, impervious paper, or other approved impermeable materials placed in close contact \nwith concrete surfaces to keep them continuously wet. Provide additional moisture inside the enclosure in \naccordance with Section 424.4.2.7.1., “Water Curing,” if this is not enough to keep exposed concrete \nsurfaces continuously wet. \n4.2.7.3. Membrane Curing. Liquid membrane-forming curing compound is a moisture retention covering that is \napplied as a liquid. It is permitted only as specified in Section 424.4.2.7., “Curing of Concrete.” \nUse Type 1-D or Type 2 membrane curing compound in accordance with DMS-4650\n. Apply membrane \ncuring compound using equipment and in a manner specified in Section 420.3.5., “Spraying Equipment,” and \nSection 420.4.10.3., “Membrane Curing,” respectively. \nDo not contaminate reinforcing steel, embedments, or concrete surfaces that will later be in direct contact \nwith cast-in-place concrete unless the curing compound can be completely removed to the satisfaction of the \nEngineer when applying membrane curing compound. \nUse membrane curing compounds that do not appreciably stain the concrete. \n4.2.7.4. Accelerated Curing. Accelerated curing is defined as curing using artificial heat provided to the curing \nenclosure or forms. \nTest accelerated curing facilities for at least 48 hr. to demonstrate temperature variations do not exceed 20°F \nbetween any points in the curing enclosure. Submit accelerated curing facility drawings and test results, and \nobtain approval before using these facilities for Department work. The test may be performed on the entire \ncasting line with either freshly cast concrete inside the forms or with empty forms. Provide one curing \nenclosure air temperature probe per 100 ft. of casting line when accelerated curing facilities are being tested. \nMaintain the air temperature in the curing enclosure between 50°F and 85°F until initial set of the concrete \n(as determined in accordance with Tex-440-A\n when establishing mix designs under representative \ntemperature conditions) and for at least 3 hr. after concrete placement. The concrete temperature may then \nbe raised uniformly at a maximum rate of 36°F per hour. Provide an unobstructed air space of at least 6 in. \nbetween surfaces of the concrete and the curing jacket. \nMonitor and maintain the curing enclosure air temperature between 50°F and 160°F during accelerated \ncuring for prestressed and nonstressed concrete members. Do not allow the air temperature to exceed \n160°F for more than 1 cumulative hr.  during the entire curing period. Do not allow the air temperature to \nexceed 170°F at any time during the specified curing period. Arrange the location of the heat discharge into \nthe curing enclosure so temperature variations do not exceed 20°F between any points in the curing \nenclosure. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n578 \nProvide curing enclosure air temperature probes to monitor the temperature at the concrete surface as \nspecified in Table 2. \nProvide enough moisture inside the curing enclosure to keep exposed concrete surfaces continuously wet for \nthe specified curing period. \nProvide other acceptable curing methods for the remaining curing period if accelerated curing is terminated \nbefore the specified curing period has elapsed. \n4.2.7.4.1. Steam Curing. Steam cure in conformance with the requirements of accelerated curing. Position steam \noutlets so live steam is not applied directly on the concrete, forms, or test cylinders. \n4.2.7.4.2. Alternate Methods. Other methods of accelerated curing, such as the use of radiant heaters or portable \nheater, may be permitted if they meet the requirements of accelerated curing. The use of any alternate \nmethod requires written approval. \n4.2.8. Detensioning. Release the tension in the strands after concrete strength requirements are met using a \nsequence to minimize premature wire breakage or shock and damage to the concrete members. Release \nstrands by multiple-strand detensioning or single-strand flame detensioning. Ensure strands are not released \nindividually with single-strand jacks. \nFlame-release each strand simultaneously at both ends of the casting bed, using a symmetrical sequence \nprepared by a licensed professional engineer, if strands are released individually. Heat the strands over an \napproved strand length and duration when flame detensioning so that the metal slowly elongates and \ngradually loses strength. Do not abruptly flame-cut strand by holding the heat source in a concentrated \nlocation on the strand. Submit the flame-release procedures and sequences for approval. Approval of flame-\nrelease sequences does not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for meeting the product workmanship \nrequirements of Section 424.4.3., “Workmanship.” \nRelease the tension in the strand hold-down anchor slowly to minimize shock and damage to the concrete \nmember when draped strands are used. Heat the anchor until the metal slowly elongates and gradually loses \nstrength if heat is used to release the hold-down anchor. Provide positive external hold-downs to offset the \nvertical forces in the members when the sum of the hold-down forces is greater than half the weight of the \nmember or for any amount of vertical force that has previously caused cracking. External hold-downs are to \nremain on each member until detensioning has been completed. \n4.3. Workmanship. Formed surfaces must not have excessive surface honeycombing, aggregate or mortar \npockets, air voids, lift lines, stains, or vibrator marks. Remove form-joint-offset marks exceeding the \ntolerances specified in Section 424.4.2.1.1., “External Forms,” and fins and rough edges along chamfer lines, \nin a manner that will not damage the member. Repair fabrication holes, except box beam and U-beam drain \nholes, using an approved repair material and procedure. \nRecess strands in accordance with the Concrete Repair Manual unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nSubmit for approval any other moisture-barrier systems for protecting strands. \nBefore shipment of members, remove: \n concrete, paste, dirt, oil, or other bond-breaking substances from exposed reinforcing steel, and \n laitance, dirt, oil, or other bond-breaking substances from concrete surfaces to be in contact with \ncast-in-place concrete. \n4.3.1. Defects and Breakage. Members that sustain damage or surface defects during fabrication, handling, \nstorage, hauling, or erection are subject to review. Evaluate and repair members in accordance with the \nConcrete Repair Manual. Submit proposed deficiencies in accordance with the Department’s NCR guidelines \nand obtain approval before performing repairs. Repair work must reestablish the member’s structural \nintegrity, durability, and aesthetics to the satisfaction of the Engineer. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n579 \nWhen deficiencies occur, determine the cause and take immediate corrective action. Failure to take \ncorrective action, leading to similar repetitive deficiencies, could be cause for rejection of members. \nCracks that extend to the nearest reinforcement plane and fine surface cracks that do not extend to the \nnearest reinforcement plane, but are numerous or extensive, are subject to review. \nCracks in prestressed members that tend to close upon transfer of stress to the concrete are acceptable. \nCracks that do not tend to close are subject to review. \nSeal cracks in I-beam ends exceeding 0.005 in. in width as directed. The fabricator must decrease the \nspacing of Bars R and S in I-beam by providing additional bars to help limit crack width. No less than 1-in. \nclearance between bars will be permitted. The fabricator must take approved corrective actions if cracks \ngreater than 0.005 in. form. All work, material, and engineering related to these cracks will be at the \nContractor’s expense. \nPrestressed bridge deck panels will be rejected for any of the following conditions: \n any crack extending to the reinforcing plane and running parallel and within 1 in. of a strand for at least \n1/3 of the embedded strand length; or \n any transverse or diagonal crack, including corner cracks and breaks, intersecting at least two adjacent \nstrands and extending to the reinforcing plane. \nPrestressed bridge deck panels that sustain damage, cracks not listed above, or surface defects during \nfabrication, handling, storage, hauling, or erection are subject to review. \n4.3.2. Tolerances. \n4.3.2.1. Prestressed Members. Allowable tolerances for the dimensions and configurations shown on the plans or \napproved shop drawings are shown in Table 3. \nVariations greater than those specified in Table 3 are subject to review. However, these tolerances do not \nrelieve the Contractor from the responsibility of furnishing a completed structure that is in reasonably close \nconformity with the lines, grades, cross-sections, dimensions, and details specified. Correct members not \nmeeting these tolerances at no additional expense to the Department, to achieve a satisfactory completed \nstructure. This also includes costs for correction due to variations in vertical beam camber. Correction may \nrequire replacement of the member. \nHorizontal misalignment (sweep) in beams, which may increase later and exceed the tolerance shown in \nTable 3, may be acceptable if the members can be hauled, erected, and aligned to within the allowable \ntolerance without being damaged. Store these members in a manner that will minimize the sweep. \nEmbedments must be firmly held in proper position to avoid movement during concrete placement. Place \nembedments in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Place weld clip inserts for \npermanent metal deck forming no more than 1/16 in. from the beam edge. \n\n2024 Specifications  424 \n580 \nTable 3 \nAllowable Tolerances for Prestressed Members \nDimension I-beams U-beams Box Beams Double-T \nBeams \nBridge Deck \nPanels \nPiling Wall Panels\n1\n \nLength (perpendicular to strands for bridge \ndeck panels) \n±1” ±1” ±1” ±3/4” ±1/2” −1”\n2\n ±3/16” \nWidth (parallel to strands for bridge deck \npanels) \n+3/4” \n−1/4” \n±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/4” ±3/16” \nNominal depth (thickness in case of panels) +1/2” \n−1/4” \n±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” +1/4” \n−1/8” \n±1/4” ±3/16” \nThickness: top slab or flange +1/2” \n−1/4” \n±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/4” N/A N/A N/A \nThickness: bottom slab or flange +1/2” \n−1/4” \n±1/2” ±1/2” N/A N/A N/A N/A \nThickness: web or wall +3/4” \n−1/4” \n±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/4” N/A N/A N/A \nHorizontal alignment (deviation from \nstraightness of all panel edges) \n±1/8” per \n10’ of length \n±1/8” per 10’ \nof length, \n3/4” Max \n±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/8” ±1/8” per 10’ \nof length \n±1/8” per 10’ \nof length, \n1/2” Max \nDeviation of ends (horizontal skew) ±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/2” ±1/8” ±1/4” per 5’ of \nwidth, \n1/2” Max \nDeviation of ends (vertical batter) ±1/2”\n8\n ±1/2”\n8\n ±1/2” ±1/2” N/A ±1/8” ±1/4” \nNotched end areas (for diaphragms): depth ±1/4” N/A ±1/4” ±1/4” N/A N/A N/A \nNotched end areas (for diaphragms): length +2” \n−1” \nN/A +2” \n−1” \n+2” \n−1” \nN/A N/A N/A \nBearing surfaces: perpendicular to vertical axis ±1/8” N/A N/A ±1/16” N/A N/A N/A \nBearing surfaces: deviation from plane ±1/16” ±1/8” ±1/8” ±1/16” N/A N/A ±1/16\n3\n \nAnchor hole location: from end of member +3/4” \n−1/4” \n±1/4” ±1/4” +3/4” \n−1/4” \nN/A N/A N/A \nAnchor hole location: longitudinal spacing ±3/4” ±1/2” ±1/2” ±3/4” N/A N/A N/A \nAnchor hole location: transverse location ±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” N/A N/A N/A \nDiaphragm or lateral tie location ±1/2” N/A ±1/2” ±1/2” N/A N/A N/A \nPosition of internal void form (longitudinal for \nbox beams and U-beams) \nN/A ±1” ±1”\n4,5 \nN/A N/A ±1/2” N/A \nProjection of reinforcing steel outside member +1/2” \n−3/4” \n+1/2” \n−3/4” \n+1/2” \n−3/4” \n+1/2” \n−3/4” \n+1/2” \n−3/4” \nN/A +1/2” \n−3/4” \nPosition of strands: \nvertical \n±1/4”\n6 \n±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/8”\n7\n ±1/4” ±1/8” \nPosition of strands: \nhorizontal \n±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/4” ±1/2” ±1/4” ±1/2” \nDebonded length of strands ±3” ±3” ±3” ±3” N/A N/A N/A \nPosition of strand hold-down points ±6” ±6” N/A ±6” N/A N/A N/A \nPosition of handling devices: parallel to length ±6” ±6” ±6” ±6” As shown on \nthe plans \n±6” ±6” \nPosition of handling devices: transverse to \nlength \n±1” ±1” ±1” ±1” As shown on \nthe plans \n±1” ±1” \nLocal flatness of formed surfaces (excluding \nbearing surface) \n±1/4” in 10’ ±1/4” in 10’ ±1/4” in 10’ ±1/4” in 10’ ±1/4” ±1/4” in 10’ ±1/4” in 10’ \nBow (length and width) N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A ±1/4” per 10’ \n1.

Properly handle, \nstore, haul, and erect all members so that they are placed in the structure in a manner to avoid excessive \nbending stresses and without damage. Lift members with approved lifting devices as shown on the shop \ndrawings or as approved. \nMaintain beams in an upright position at all times, and raise and support them near the ends to prevent \ntorsion unless approved on shop or erection drawings. \nDo not move members from the casting yard until all requirements of the pertinent Items have been met. \nHaul beams to the project site after at least 7 days have elapsed since casting, unless otherwise approved. \nThe storage area must be clean and well drained. Prevent excessive or differential settlement of members by \nstoring on: \n stable ground and \n dunnage of sufficient size, shape, and strength to prevent crushing. \nPlace dunnage a distance no more than 3% of the beam length from the beam ends. When approved, \ncantilever beams may be supported at locations other than near the ends. Support concrete box beams and \nU-   beams under the solid end block area during handling, storage, hauling, and erection. \nSeparate members with blocking arranged in vertical planes that will not crush under load when members \nare stacked. Stack members so lifting devices are accessible and undamaged. Use dunnage or blocking \nmaterial that will not damage or stain the required finish. \nRearrange improperly stored members and inspect them for damage. Members that are improperly stored \nand become cracked, warped, or otherwise damaged in storage may be rejected. \nSecurely tie or brace all beams during erection in conformance with minimum erection and bracing \nstandards. Protect traffic against falling objects during the erection of diaphragms and other structural \nmembers, during the placing of cast-in-place concrete, and during the erection and dismantling of forms \nwhen railroad or roadway traffic must be maintained beneath beams already placed. Protect traffic with nets \nor flooring with openings not larger than 1 in. or as approved. \nFit mating surfaces to prevent excessive grout leakage when erecting precast prestressed concrete bridge \ndeck panels. Fill the joint with grout or seal it with an acceptable caulking compound before placing the \ncast-in-place portion of the slab if such fit is not provided. \nFinish surfaces of beams or other members after slab placement in accordance with Section 420.4.13., \n“Ordinary Surface Finish,” and Item 427. \nCorrect beam discrepancies including, but not limited to horizontal misalignment or variations in vertical \ncamber, to achieve a satisfactory completed structure at no additional expense to the Department. Correction \nmay require replacement of the member. \n3.2. Packaging, Storing, and Handling of Prestressing Steel. Protect prestressing steel against physical \ndamage and rust or other results of corrosion, from manufacture to grouting or encasing in concrete. \nPrestressing steel with physical damage will be rejected. Replace any reel containing broken wires. Provide \nwire that is bright and uniformly colored, without foreign matter or pitting on the surface. \n\n2024 Specifications  425 \n584 \nPackage prestressing steel in containers or shipping forms for protection from physical damage and \ncorrosion during shipping and storage. A corrosion inhibitor must be: \n placed in the package or form, \n incorporated in a corrosion inhibitor carrier type packaging material, or \n applied directly to the steel when permitted. \nThe corrosion inhibitor must not have deleterious effect on the steel, concrete, or bond strength of steel to \nconcrete. Inhibitor carrier-type packaging material must conform to the provisions of federal specification \nMIL-PRF-3420 G. Immediately replace damaged packaging or forms, or restore them to original condition. \nHave the shipping package or form clearly marked with the corrosion inhibitor type, packaging date, and a \nstatement that the package contains high-strength prestressing steel. \nHandle prestressing steel carefully to avoid abrading, nicking, or kinking the strand, bar, or wire. Protect \nprestressing steel from damage and corrosion by storing it above the ground on platforms, skids, or other \napproved supports. Any pitting or tightly adhering rust on prestressing steel will be cause for rejection of the \nsteel. Do not weld or torch-cut near any prestressing steel, so that it is not exposed to weld spatter, direct \nheat, or short-circuited current flow. \nWhen prestressing steel for post-tensioning is installed in the ducts, any rust that forms during the first \n14 days after installation will not be cause for rejection of the steel. \n4.

No more than 15% reduction is permitted.   \nMatch the color of the applied coating with the color standard as shown on the plans. Apply when ambient \ntemperature is between 50°F and 100°F. \n4.2.2.2. Adhesive Grout. Apply coating on a moistened surface to a uniform minimum thickness of 1/16 in. Apply \nwhen ambient temperature is at least 50°F. \n4.3. Special Surface Finishes. Submit a work plan to the Engineer for any special finish shown on the plans. \nInclude in the work plan the type of aggregates, materials, variation of panel or pattern arrangement, \ndimensions, construction methods, and other features affecting the work as necessary for the “Special \nSurface Finish” specified. \n4.3.1. Blast Finish. Provide surface profile as shown on the plans, or meet the minimum requirements of \nSection 427.4.2.1., “Preparation.” Construct a 4 × 4-ft. sample panel using the same concrete used in \nconstruction of the member to receive the blast finish. Prepare the surface of the sample panel to meet the \n\n2024 Specifications  427 \n592 \nspecified finish, and obtain approval of the sample finish. Use the approved sample panel finish as the \nstandard for surfaces requiring a blast finish. \n4.3.2. Slurry Coat Finish. Provide cementitious slurry coat finish to concrete surfaces within 14 days of placing \nconcrete or later as approved. Water blast surface to moisten surface before application when application of \nslurry coat occurs more than 14 days after placing concrete. Do not apply slurry coat finish to surfaces \nreceiving another type of coating finish. \nSubmit for approval proposed slurry recipe including cement, latex concrete additive, with or without sand, \nand other additives before application. The Engineer will direct the level of surface texture the slurry coat will \nhave, whether to include sand, and what fineness of sand is to be used. Tint mixture of slurry as specified on \nthe plans and as directed. Maintain consistent slurry throughout project, only modifying recipe to account for \ncolor variations noticed as work progresses. \nRub in slurry using carborundum stone, stiff bristle brush, or other approved device. Limit thickness of \napplied slurry to a maximum of 1/16 in. Demonstrate application methods for slurry coat and obtain approval \nof proposed surface. Apply slurry coat to obtain a tightly adhering cementitious finish to concrete surface. \nRemove material and reapply if slurry coat is not tightly adhering or is cracked. \n4.3.3. Rub Finish. Provide a finish to the surface by rubbing the surface with a carborundum stone or other \napproved material. Begin rubbing the surface immediately after forms have been removed. Provide blast \nfinish or other finish as directed at no additional cost to the Department if rubbing surface is delayed to the \npoint where the surface is dry and unable to be rubbed to produce an acceptable finish. Perform the \nrequirements to obtain the ordinary surface finish specified in Section 420.4.13., “Ordinary Surface Finish,” \nconcurrently with rubbing the surface. Rub concrete-patching areas after the patch material has thoroughly \nset and blend the patch in with the surrounding area to produce a surface with uniform color and texture \nwhere concrete patching is performed. \nKeep the surface continuously wet after form removal until the rubbing is complete. Rub the surface \nsufficiently to bring the wetted concrete surface to a paste, producing a smooth, dense surface without pits, \nform marks, or other irregularities. Do not use cement grout to form the paste on the surface. Stripe the \nsurface using a brush to conceal the rubbing pattern and allow the paste to reset. Wash the concrete with \npotable water after the paste has sufficiently set to leave it with a neat and uniform appearance and texture. \nApply membrane curing, if required, in accordance with Item 420, “Concrete Substructures,” after rubbing is \ncomplete. \n4.3.4. Off-the-Form Finish. Provide a finish with minimal surface defects and uniform color and texture by using \nnon-staining, non-porous, high-quality forming materials. Use the same type of forming materials for like \nelements for the entire structure. \nUse mortar-tight forms to prevent leakage and discoloration. Seal joints using compressible gasket material, \ncaulk, or tape, or by other suitable means that are not detrimental to the concrete finish, if necessary. Use \none brand and type of form-release agents for all surfaces unless another product produces a similar \nconcrete surface appearance. Do not use barrier-type (e.g., wax, fuel oil, and carrier oil) release agents. Use \nform-release agents containing a rust inhibitor on steel forms. Clean rust off steel forms before use. Use \nplywood that will not cause discoloration of the concrete surface. \nDirect special attention to consolidation and vibration of the concrete around the form surfaces to minimize \nbug holes. Modify concrete placement and vibration techniques if surface contains an excessive amount of \nbug holes. Remove all forms without interruption once form removal begins to prevent discoloration due to \ndiffering form curing times. \nDo not use membrane curing on surfaces with off-the-form finish. \nRepair honeycombed and spall areas with least dimension larger than 2 in. in accordance with the concrete \nsurface repair procedures in Item 420 to obtain an ordinary surface finish as defined in Section 420.4.13., \n“Ordinary Surface Finish.” Patch honeycombed and spall areas with least dimension greater than 3/4 in. but \n\n2024 Specifications  427 \n593 \nsmaller than 2 in. by filling defect with repair material omitting the chipping operation. Do not patch \nhoneycombed and spall areas with least dimension smaller than 3/4 in. Perform required repairs as soon as \nforms are removed. Match repair material color and texture with surrounding concrete surfaces. Minimize the \narea of repair by not smearing the repair material over acceptable concrete surfaces while attempting to \nblend the repair with the surrounding concrete. Cut out form ties at least 1/2 in. below the surface, and patch \naccordingly. Perform repair work as soon as possible after removing forms so that concrete and repair \nmaterials have similar ages. Replace or refurbish the forms when the Engineer determines defective \nformwork is causing an excessive amount of repair work. \n4.3.5. Form Liner Finish. Provide patterned finish as shown on the plans. Do not splice form liner panels in a way \nthat causes a noticeable transition or line between pieces. Wash and clean form liners after each use when \nthe forms can be reused. Replace form liners that have become damaged or worn. \nConstruct a sample panel for each form liner finish. Approval is required to verify the sample panel meets the \nrequirements shown on the plans and in conformance with specifications before beginning work. Upon \napproval, the sample panel becomes the model panel to which all other work will be compared. Deviation in \ncolor, grade, or depth from the model panel is grounds for rejection of the form liner finish. Removal of \ndefective work may be necessary as determined by the Engineer and in accordance with the surface finish \nrequirements in Item 420 to obtain an ordinary surface finish as defined in Section 420.4.13., “Ordinary \nSurface Finish.” \nSeal all form liner joints in a manner acceptable to the Engineer to prevent leakage at the surface. \n4.3.6. Exposed Aggregate Finish. Provide exposed aggregate finish as shown on the plans. Provide a depth of \nfinish between 3/8 in. and 1/2 in. unless directed otherwise. \nApply a concrete surface retarder that penetrates approximately 1/4 in. into the forms or concrete surface to \nhelp achieve the desired finish. Apply two or three coats to wood forms to account for absorption if \nnecessary. Tape or caulk form joints to prevent escape of the retarder during the placing operations. Protect \nthe form surfaces from sun and rain while exposed to the atmosphere. Re-treat form surfaces with retarder if \ndisturbed. Protect adjacent areas of concrete not requiring exposed aggregate finish from the retarder. \nRemove forms 12–15 hr. after concrete placement but not before concrete has gained sufficient strength to \nsupport the self-weight of the member,  unless directed otherwise. Expose the aggregate for the finish \nimmediately after form removal. Remove the grout paste covering the aggregate to be exposed by an \napproved method. Do not loosen the aggregate by the grout removal operation. Maintain required curing on \nall surfaces except for the time while the aggregate is being exposed. Cure using wet mats or membrane \nafter the aggregate is exposed. \nRepair defective areas as determined by the Engineer. \nRe-clean exposed aggregate surfaces by an approved method. Apply a coat of clear Type II permanent \nanti-graffiti coating to cleaned exposed aggregate surface. Apply anti-graffiti coatings by spray, roller, or \nbrush at the application rates recommended by the manufacturer and in accordance with Item 740, “Graffiti \nRemoval and Anti-Graffiti Coating.” \n5.

Grade the area of proposed work accurately to the elevation and dimensions shown \non the plans when concrete is to be placed against soil. Compact with sufficient moisture to provide a firm \nfoundation and to prevent absorption of water from the concrete but without free surface moisture. \nRemove paint, rust, loose mill scale, grease or oil, and all other foreign materials that may reduce the bond of \nthe concrete to the steel when concrete is used to encase structural steel members. \nRemove all deteriorated or loose material by chipping with pneumatic, electric, or hand tools when concrete \nis placed against concrete or rock. Cut square or slightly undercut shoulders approximately 1 in. deep along \nthe perimeter of repair areas. Sandblast the surface to clean all rust from exposed reinforcing steel and to \nproduce a clean rough-textured surface on the concrete or rock. Place the concrete while the substrate is in \na saturated surface-dry (SSD) condition. Achieve SSD conditions by high-pressure water blasting 15–30 min. \nbefore placing the repair material. An SSD condition is achieved when the surface remains damp until the \nconcrete is applied. The surface must be free of standing water. Remove all free (ponded) water just before \nplacing concrete.  \nProvide joints, side forms, headers, and shooting strips for backing or paneling. Use ground or gauging wires \nwhere necessary to establish thickness, surface planes, and finish lines. \n3.3. Reinforcement. Place and secure reinforcement to ensure there is no displacement from impact of applying \npneumatically placed concrete. Place reinforcing bars at a spacing not less than 2-1/2 in. Support reinforcing \nwire fabric or bars using mushroom-headed anchors, expansion hook bolts, or grouted rebar capable of \nresisting a pullout force of 2,500 lb. Space anchors no more than 12 in. center-to-center on overhead \nsurfaces, 18 in. center-to-center on vertical surfaces, and 36 in. center-to-center on top horizontal surfaces. \nUse at least three anchors in each patch area. Do not use explosive force to shoot anchors into concrete. \nCheck the resistance to pullout of the reinforcing anchors when directed. Notify the Engineer before \ninstallation of the anchors. Locate anchors so there is no damage to prestressing tendons or conduits \nembedded in the concrete. \nUse reinforcement when performing repair work in all areas where the thickness of the concrete will exceed \n1-  1/2 in. Use a single layer of either 2 × 2—W1.2 × W1.2 or 3 × 3 —W1.5 × W1.5 of welded wire fabric, or \n\n2024 Specifications  431 \n602 \napproved equivalent, unless otherwise shown on the plans. Use a single layer of wire fabric to reinforce each \n4-in. thickness of patch or fractional part in areas where the concrete thickness exceeds 4 in. Encase \ncompletely each layer of wire fabric in concrete that has taken its initial set before installing the succeeding \nlayer of wire fabric. Place the reinforcing fabric parallel to the finished surface and support it so it will be at \nleast 3/4 in. out from the surface to be covered. Provide at least 1 in. of clearance between the finished \nconcrete surface and all steel items, including anchors, reinforcing bars, and wire fabric. Lap adjacent fabric \nsheets at least 6 in. and tie together securely at a spacing of no more than 18 in. Pre-bend fabric before \ninstalling to fit around corners and into re-entrant angles. \nPre-bend the welded wire fabric for encasement of steel members using a template to conform as nearly as \npossible to the outlines of the members to be encased. Drill holes between 1/2 and 1 in. in diameter in the \nwebs of the members as close as possible to the flanges to allow for attachment of the reinforcing fabric. \nSpace these holes at approximately 3 ft. on center. Use 3/8-in. diameter rods placed through these holes to \nsecure the reinforcing fabric. Hold the reinforcing fabric at least 3/4 in. out from the surface of the steel \nmember. Lap adjacent fabric sheets at least 6 in. and tie together at a spacing of no more than 12 in.  \n3.4. Pneumatic Placement of Concrete. Pneumatically applied concrete can be either dry-mix or wet-mix. The \ndry-mix process consists of dry-mixed fine aggregate and hydraulic cement to which water is added \nimmediately before its pneumatic expulsion from a nozzle. The wet-mix process consists of mechanically \npremixed concrete pneumatically applied through a nozzle. \n3.4.1. General. Place the concrete when the ambient temperature is above 35°F and rising and material \ntemperature is between 50°F and 90°F for wet-mix and below 100°F for dry-mix. Do not place concrete \nagainst a surface containing frost, ice, or standing water. Protect concrete from freezing or quick drying after \nplacement. Apply the concrete using pneumatic equipment that sprays the mix onto the prepared surface at \na velocity less than 100 ft. per second for construction of portions of structures, repairing concrete structures, \nor encasement of structural steel members. Minimize rebound and produce a compacted dense \nhomogenous mass. Do not apply concrete if high winds will prevent proper application or if rain could wash \nout the concrete. \nHold the nozzle approximately 2–4 ft. from the surface and position it so the concrete impinges nearly at right \nangles to the surface being covered. Use shooting strips to ensure straight lines, square corners, and a plane \nsurface of concrete. Place to keep the trapping of rebound to a minimum. Slope the concrete off to a thin \nedge at the end of each day’s work or at similar stopping periods requiring construction joint. Thoroughly \nclean and wet previously placed concrete before placing an adjacent or additional section. Apply a sufficient \nnumber of coats to obtain the required thickness. Place coats on vertical and overhead surfaces in layers of \nsuch thickness to prevent sloughing, sagging, tearing, or debonding. Provide a sufficient interval between \nsuccessive layers in sloping, vertical, or overhead work to allow initial but not final set. Clean the surface to \nremove the thin film of laitance to provide for a bond with succeeding applications. Remove rebound and \naccumulated loose sand from the surface to be covered before placing the original or succeeding layers of \nconcrete. Correct any sags or other defects to the proper section as directed. \nPlace concrete to completely encase reinforcing steel. Encase reinforcing steel by shooting with sufficient \nvelocity and plasticity that material flows around and behind reinforcement. \nApply the concrete using either the wet-mix or dry-mix process unless otherwise shown on the plans. Mix the \nmaterials thoroughly and uniformly using a paddle or drum-type mixer designed for pneumatic application. \nWet-mix process applications can use transit-mix concrete. Do not use the wet-mix process for repair of \ndamaged concrete. \nClean mixing and placing equipment at regular intervals. Inspect the nozzle liner and water and air injection \nsystem daily; replace worn parts as necessary. \nDo not reuse rebound or overspray concrete. \n3.4.2. Dry-Mix Process. Use a compressor or blower capable of delivering a sufficient volume of oil-free air at the \npressure shown in Table 2. Maintain steady pressure throughout the placing process. \n\n2024 Specifications  431 \n603 \nUse a water pump with the size and capacity to deliver water to the nozzle with a pressure at least 15 psi \nmore than the required air pressure. \nThe values shown in Table 2 are based on a hose length of 150 ft. with the nozzle less than 25 ft. above the \ndelivery equipment. Increase operating pressure approximately 5 psi for each additional 50 ft. of hose and \napproximately 5 psi for each 25 ft. the nozzle is raised. \n \nTable 2 \nCompressor Capacities \nCompressor  \nCapacity,  \ncu. ft/min. \nHose  \nDiameter, in. \nMaximum Size  \nof Nozzle Tip, in.  \nOperating  \nAir Pressure  \nAvailable, psi \n250 1 3/4 40 \n315 1-1/4 1 45 \n365 1-1/2 1-1/4 55 \n500 1-5/8 1-1/2 65 \n600 1-3/4 1-5/8 75 \n750 2 1-3/4 85 \n3.4.3. Wet-Mix Process. Operate the pump at a line pressure between 100 psi and 300 psi. Use delivery hoses \nbetween 1-1/2 in. and 3 in. in diameter. Use mixing equipment capable of thoroughly mixing the materials in \nsufficient quantity to maintain continuous placement. \n3.5. Construction Joints. Use a square butt joint where the joint is subject to compressive stress or is over \nexisting construction joints,  unless otherwise shown on the plans. Use tapered or square butt joints at other \nlocations. Square the outside 1 in. of tapered joints perpendicular to the surface. \n3.6. Finish. Use a sharp trowel to cut off all high spots after the concrete has been placed to the desired \nthickness or screed to a true plane as determined by shooting strips or by the original concrete surface. \nLightly apply cutting screeds, where used, to all surfaces so as not to disturb the concrete for an appreciable \ndepth. Work in an upward direction when concrete is applied on vertical surfaces. Give the finished concrete \na final flash coat of approximately 1/8 in. unless directed otherwise. Obtain a uniform appearance on all \nexposed surfaces unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n3.7. Curing. Cure encasements with water for 4 days. Cure repairs and structural construction using either a \npiece of wet burlap taped over the repaired area with a covering of 4-mil minimum plastic sheet also taped in \nplace or membrane curing as approved. Overlap the burlap with the plastic sheet and continuously tape the \nedges with a tape at least 3 in. wide (air duct tape or better) to completely enclose the mat and hold in \nmoisture. Cure in this manner for 4 days. Curing is not required for soil-nail walls unless walls are the final \nexposed surfaces; in this case, cure at least 4 days in accordance with Item 420. Apply membrane curing in \naccordance with Section 420.2.7., “Curing Materials,” for tunnel and ditch linings and vertical or overhead \npatches as approved. \n3.8. Repair of Defects. Repair or replace debonded areas as directed. \n4. MEASUREMENT \nMeasurement of pneumatically placed concrete for encasement of structural members will be by the square \nfoot of the actual contact area. \nMeasurement of pneumatically placed concrete for repair of concrete structures will be by the cubic foot in \nplace using the surface area times the average depth of the patch. When pneumatically placed concrete for \nrepair of concrete structures is allowed or specified for Item 429, “Concrete Structure Repair,” measurement \nand payment are in accordance with Article 429.5., “Payment.”  \n\n2024 Specifications  431 \n604 \n5.

Place a tape measure along the riprap and determine the intermediate axis size of the stone \nat 2-ft. intervals. Measure at least 100 stones, either in a single transect or in multiple transects, then follow \nASTM D5519, Test Method D to determine the gradation, unless otherwise directed. Table 2 is a guide for \ncomparing the stone size in inches to the stone weight shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 2 \nProtection Riprap Stone Size\n1 \nNominal \nSize \nDmax  \n(in.) \nD90 \n(in.) \nD50 \n(in.) \nD8 \n(in.) \n12 in. 13.76 10.14–13.29 7.31–9.92 3.39 \n15 in. 16.10 13.04–15.75 9.21–12.91 6.39 \n18 in. 19.04 15.58–18.36 11.10–14.21 6.59 \n21 in. 21.85 18.17–21.09 13.16–15.75 6.88 \n24 in. 23.53 19.28–22.29 13.76–16.18 7.31 \n30 in. 32.36 24.65–30.84 17.34–22.72 8.05 \n36 in. 38.56 30.61–37.04 21.85–28.09 12.22 \n1.

CONSTRUCTION \nDress slopes and protected areas to the line and grade shown on the plans before the placement of riprap. \nPlace riprap and toe walls as shown on the plans or as directed. \n3.1. Concrete Riprap. Reinforce concrete riprap with 6 × 6 –   W2.9 × W2.9 welded wire fabric or with No. 3 or \nNo. 4 reinforcing bars spaced at a maximum of 18 in. in each direction unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nAlternative styles of welded wire fabric that provide at least 0.058 sq. in. of steel per foot in both directions \nmay be used if approved. A combination of welded wire fabric and reinforcing bars may be provided when \nboth are permitted. Provide a minimum 6-in. lap at all splices. Provide horizontal cover of at least 1 in. and no \nmore than 3 in. at the edge of the riprap. Place the first parallel bar no more than 6 in. from the edge of \nconcrete. Use approved supports to hold the reinforcement approximately equidistant from the top and \nbottom surface of the slab. Adjust reinforcement during concrete placement to maintain correct position. \nSprinkle or sprinkle and consolidate the subgrade before the concrete is placed as directed. All surfaces \nmust be moist when concrete is placed. \nCompact and shape the concrete once it has been placed to conform to the dimensions shown on the plans. \nFinish the surface with a wood float after it has set sufficiently to avoid slumping to secure a smooth surface \nor broom finish as approved. \nCure the riprap immediately after the finishing operation in accordance with Item 420. \n3.2. Stone Riprap.\n Provide the following types of stone riprap when shown on the plans. \n Dry Riprap. Stone riprap with voids filled with only spalls or small stones. \n Grouted Riprap. Type R, F, or Common stone riprap with voids grouted after all the stones are in \nplace. \n Mortared Riprap. Type F stone riprap laid and mortared as each stone is placed. \nUse spalls and small stones lighter than 25 lb. to fill open joints and voids in stone riprap, and place to a tight \nfit. \nPlace mortar or grout only when the air temperature is above 35°F. Protect work from rapid drying for at least \n3   days after placement. \nFor slope or wave protection, if filter fabric is required, place filter fabric with its long axis running up and \ndown the slope unless otherwise approved. For stream bank protection, if filter fabric is required, place the \nfilter fabric with its long axis parallel to the centerline of the channel unless otherwise approved. Overlap the \nuphill or upstream sheet over the downhill or downstream sheet. For above water applications, ensure \n\n2024 Specifications  432 \n608 \nadjacent sheets of filter fabric have a minimum overlap of 2 ft. in each direction. Secure filter fabric in place \nwith nails or pins. Use 12-in. long, 3/16-in. diameter nails with 1.5-in. washers, or U-shaped steel pins with \neach leg at least 9 in. long. Space nails or pins at a maximum of 10 ft. in each direction and 5 ft. along the \nseams. Along the seams, place nails or pins through both strips of filter fabric at approximately the midpoint \nof the overlap. Place additional nails or pins as necessary to hold the filter fabric in position. Alternative \nanchorage and spacing may be used when approved. Keep the fabric material free of tension, stress, folds, \nwrinkles, or creases. \nMethods for underwater filter placement must be approved before installation. For underwater placement, \nfilter fabric should be unrolled in the direction of flow, overlapped at least 3 ft., and secured with sandbags, \nrocks, nails, or pins to prevent distortion. To prevent segregation and transport, underwater installation of a \ngranular filter must be by clamshell bucket or tremie, with the granular material released on or very near the \nbed, unless otherwise approved. Underwater placement of a granular filter is permitted only if the water \nvelocity is less than 5 ft. per second unless otherwise approved. \nAny defects, tears, holes, flaws, or damage to filter fabric may be cause for rejection. Repair torn or \npunctured filter fabric by placing an additional layer of filter fabric over the damaged area, ensuring a \nminimum overlap of 3 ft. beyond the damaged area in all directions, and securing the filter fabric in place with \npins or nails. Store filter fabric out of direct sunlight and cover the filter fabric as soon as possible after \nplacement, but within 3 days. \n3.2.1. Type R. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 1 on the Stone Riprap Standard and as shown on the plans. \nPlace stones in a single layer with close joints so most of their weight is carried by the earth and not the \nadjacent stones. Place the upright axis of the stones at an angle of approximately 90° to the embankment \nslope. Place each course from the bottom of the embankment upward with the larger stones in the lower \ncourses. \nFill open joints between stones with spalls. Place stones to create a uniform finished top surface. Do not \nexceed a 6-in. variation between the tops of adjacent stones. Replace, embed deeper, or chip away stones \nthat project more than the allowable amount above the finished surface. \nPrevent earth, sand, or foreign material from filling the spaces between the stones when the plans require \nType R stone riprap to be grouted. Wet the stones thoroughly after they are in place, fill the spaces between \nthe stones with grout, and pack. Sweep the surface of the riprap using a stiff broom after grouting. \n3.2.2. Type F. \n3.2.2.1. Dry Placement. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 2 on the Stone Riprap Standard. Set the flat surface on \na prepared horizontal earth bed and overlap the underlying course to secure a lapped surface. Place the \nlarge stones first, roughly arranged in close contact. Fill the spaces between the large stones with suitably \nsized stones placed to leave the surface evenly stepped and conforming to the contour required. Place stone \nto drain water down the face of the slope. \n3.2.2.2. Grouting. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 3 on the Stone Riprap Standard. Size, shape, and lay large \nflat-surfaced stones to produce an even surface with minimal voids. Place stones with the flat surface facing \nupward parallel to the slope. Place the largest stones near the base of the slope. Fill spaces between the \nlarger stones with stones of suitable size, leaving the surface smooth, tight, and conforming to the contour \nrequired. Place the stones to create a plane surface with a variation no more than 6 in. in 10 ft. from true \nplane. Provide the same degree of accuracy for warped and curved surfaces. Prevent earth, sand, or foreign \nmaterial from filling the spaces between the stones. Wet the stones thoroughly after they are in place, fill the \nspaces between them with grout, and pack. Sweep the surface using a stiff broom after grouting. \n3.2.2.3. Mortaring. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 2 on the Stone Riprap Standard. Lap courses as described \nfor dry placement. Wet the stones thoroughly before placing mortar. Bed the larger stones in fresh mortar as \nthey are being placed and shove adjacent stones into contact with one another. Spread excess mortar forced \nout during placement of the stones uniformly over them to fill all voids completely. Point up all joints roughly \neither with flush joints or shallow, smooth-raked joints as directed. \n\n2024 Specifications  432 \n609 \n3.2.3. Common. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 4 on the Stone Riprap Standard. Place stones on a bed \nexcavated for the base course. Bed the base course of stone well into the ground with the edges in contact. \nBed and place each succeeding course in even contact with the preceding course. Use spalls and small \nstones to fill any open joints and voids in the riprap. Ensure the finished surface presents an even, tight \nsurface, true to the line and grades of the typical sections. \nPrevent earth, sand, or foreign material from filling the spaces between the stones when the plans require \ngrouting common stone riprap. Wet the stones thoroughly after they are in place, fill the spaces between \nthem with grout,  and pack. Sweep the surface using a stiff broom after grouting. \n3.2.4. Protection. Construct riprap as shown in Figure 5 on the Stone Riprap Standard. Place riprap stone on the \nslopes within the limits shown on the plans. Place stone for riprap on the filter fabric to produce a reasonably \nwell-graded mass of riprap with the minimum practicable percentage of voids. Place riprap stone on top of \nthe filter fabric, always starting at the bottom and working toward the top of any slope. Construct the riprap to \nthe lines and grades shown on the plans or staked in the field. A tolerance of +6 in. and -0 in. from the slope \nline and grades shown on the plans is allowed in the finished surface of the riprap. Place riprap to its full \nthickness in a single operation. Avoid displacing the filter fabric. Ensure the entire mass of stones in its final \nposition is free of objectionable pockets of small stones and clusters of larger stones. Do not place riprap in \nlayers, and do not place it by dumping it into chutes, dumping it from the top of the slope, pushing it from the \ntop of the slope, or any method likely to cause segregation of the various sizes. Obtain the desired \ndistribution of the various sizes of stones throughout the mass by selective loading of material at the quarry \nor other source, or by other approved methods of placement that will produce the specified results. \nRearrange individual stones using mechanical equipment or by hand if necessary to obtain a reasonably \nwell-graded distribution of stone sizes. If required, use the bedding thickness shown on the plans and place \nstone for riprap on the bedding material to produce a reasonably well-graded mass of riprap with the \nminimum practicable percentage of voids. \n3.3. Pneumatically Placed Concrete Riprap, Class II. Meet the requirements of Item 431. Provide \nreinforcement as shown on the plans and in accordance with Item 440.

DESCRIPTION \nFurnish and install bearings for the support of bridge superstructure and substructure members. Bridge \nbearings under this specification consist of the two following categories and subcategories. \n1.1. Elastomeric Bridge Bearings. \n Plain Elastomeric Bearings. Consisting of elastomer only. \n Laminated Elastomeric Bearings. Consisting of alternating individual layers of elastomer and steel \nlaminates, with or without a steel top plate and special components (steel guide bars and bottom plate). \n Sliding Elastomeric Bearings. Consisting of a steel top (sole) plate with a stainless steel facing (upper \ncomponent) bearing on a lower component. The lower component consists of a layer of \npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) recessed and bonded to a steel plate that is vulcanized to the top of a \nlaminated elastomeric bearing pad with or without special components (steel guide bars and bottom \nplate). \nPlain and laminated elastomeric bridge bearings are designated by hardness (durometer), size, and \nconfiguration and, in the case of laminated bearings, by the thickness of the individual layers of elastomer \nand the size and position of any steel top plates. \n1.2. High Load Multi-Rotational (HLMR) Bearings. \n Disc Bearings. Consisting of a polyether urethane disc contained between upper and lower steel \nbearing plates. The bearing has a shear-resisting mechanism to prevent relative horizontal movement of \nthe bearing plates and transmit horizontal loads. \n Pot Bearings. Consisting of a plain elastomeric disc confined by a shallow steel cylinder (pot) and a \nsteel piston that engages the cylinder sufficiently to prevent their relative horizontal movement. \nProvision for sliding movements (if required) uses a separate steel top plate with stainless steel facing (upper \ncomponent) bearing on a lower component, and a lower component with a layer of PTFE bonded to the top \nof the upper steel bearing plate of the HLMR assembly. If required on the plans, restriction of lateral \nmovement is provided by guide bars integrated with the steel top plate and interface components of the \nsame stainless-steel facing and PTFE layer. \nHLMR bridge bearings are designated by configuration (fixed, multi-direction expansion, or guided \nexpansion) and the vertical service reaction requirements. Fixed configurations allow rotation about the \nhorizontal axis and prevent horizontal movement in all directions. Multi-direction expansion configurations \nallow rotation about the horizontal axis and horizontal movement in all directions. Guided expansion \nconfigurations allow rotation about the horizontal axis and horizontal movement in one direction as shown on \nthe plans, while guide bars and keyways restrict horizontal movement in the orthogonal direction. Provide \neither disc bearings or pot bearings unless a disc or pot bearing is specifically required on the plans. Provide \na fabricator-designed HLMR bearing meeting the performance and dimensional criteria shown on the plans \nand in accordance with Section 434.2.3., “HLMR Bearings.” \nBearings consisting of hinged steel bolster and rocker shoes;  steel flat, cylindrical, or spherical bearings;  and \nsingle and multiple steel roller bearings are not covered by this Item and must be in accordance with \nItem 442, “Metal for Structures,” unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n\n2024 Specifications  434 \n612 \n2.

CONSTRUCTION OF CONCRETE OR LATEX-MODIFIED CONCRETE OVERLAYS \n4.1. General. Submit for approval a detailed work plan including equipment and manpower before beginning any \nwork. \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n627 \nThe Engineer will inform the Contractor if night placements become necessary. No additional compensation \nwill be provided for night placements of concrete. Provide enough lighting to make quality workmanship and \nadequate inspection possible during night placements. Lighting must be approved before operations begin. \nProvide enough labor and equipment for proportioning, mixing, placing, and finishing CO at a rate of at least \n40 ft. of finished overlay per hour. Do not allow traffic other than construction equipment for the overlay on \nany portion of the prepared bridge deck before the overlay has been placed. Provide side and end forms for \nsupporting the screed and containing the overlay concrete. Provide reinforcement, when required, in \naccordance with Item 440 and as shown on the plans. \nPlace concrete only when the air or deck temperature is 40°F or above and the concrete temperature is \nbetween 50°F and 85°F. Do not cart concrete batches over the completed overlay until the overlay concrete \nhas attained a 3,000-psi compressive or 425-psi flexural strength. If carts are used, provide timber planking \nof at least 3/4-in. thickness for the remainder of the curing period. Provide carts equipped with pneumatic \ntires. Do not interrupt curing operations to cart concrete over finished slabs. \nOpen the structure with the completed overlay to normal construction traffic or to the traveling public in \naccordance with Section 422.4.1., “Schedule Restrictions and Inspection Hold-Points.” \n4.2. Classification and Mix Design. Provide a mix design in accordance with Item 421. Use a water reducing \nchemical admixture as necessary to achieve the desired consistency without exceeding the specified \nwater-to-cementitious material ratio. Provide a mix design with an entrained air content of the fresh concrete \nof 6% with a tolerance of ±1% when tested in accordance with Tex-414-A or Tex-416-A\n together with the \nfollowing requirements. \n4.2.1. CO. Provide Class CO concrete with a coarse aggregate factor of at least 0.55 and add steel fibers at a rate \nof 40 lb./cu. yd. unless otherwise shown on the plans. \n4.2.2. LMC.

Use a \ncommercially available anti-foaming agent with the polymer modifier as necessary to control the air content in \nthe mix. \nPerform trial batching before placement date and verify slump, air content, temperature, compressive \nstrength, and consistency can be met. If conditions change before placement date (aggregate moisture, \nexcessive temperature changes, or other factors that may affect consistency), additional trial batching will be \nrequired as directed. This work will be subsidiary to this Item. \n4.3. Surface Preparation. Do not scarify concrete surfaces with a grooved or tined finish unless shown on the \nplans. Prepare these surfaces by abrasive blasting or water-injected abrasive blasting as required to remove \ndirt, oil, curing compound, laitance, surface mortar, and other material that would inhibit bonding of the \noverlay, but leave the striations intact. \nPrior to milling or hydro-demolition, sound the bridge deck to verify limits of overlay. Shallow saw-cut the \nperimeter of the overlay limits. Do not damage existing reinforcing. Replace damaged reinforcing at no \nadditional cost to the Department. \nScarify the surfaces of slabs to be rehabilitated to the depths shown on the plans using the method specified \nin accordance with Item 483. \nRemove and dispose of deteriorated or delaminated areas of concrete as shown on the plans or as \ndetermined using a sounding hammer, chain drag, or other acceptable device, and by visual inspection after \nscarifying as approved. \nRemove and repair deteriorated concrete below the indicated depth of scarification in accordance with \nItem 429. Use only hydraulic-cement concrete for these repairs. Ensure the repaired surface is flush with the \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n628 \nsurrounding scarified surfaces. Allow the repair concrete to cure before placing the overlay concrete unless \napproved otherwise. When approved, placing repair concrete in partial depth deck repairs may be concurrent \nwith placing the overlay concrete. \nUse a jackhammer not heavier than a nominal 30-lb. class to remove deteriorated concrete in small areas \nnot accessible to the mechanical scarifier, and to spot-remove small areas of deteriorated concrete to a \ndepth down to the existing top reinforcing steel. This class of jackhammer may also be used for concrete \nremoval between existing reinforcing bars to a greater depth. Use chipping hammers not heavier than a \nnominal 15-lb. class to remove concrete from beneath any reinforcing bars near the perimeter of the removal \narea. Avoid cutting, stretching, or damaging exposed reinforcing steel by direct impact of these power tools. \nRepair or replace reinforcing steel damaged during the concrete removal process at no additional expense to \nthe Department. Operate all jackhammers and chipping hammers at an angle of 45° or less measured from \nthe surface of the slab. \nDo not damage reinforcing steel. If more than one half of the diameter of the reinforcing bar is exposed and \nthe bar is corroded around the circumference, adjacent concrete is rust stained, or the bar is debonded from \nthe substrate concrete, chip away concrete or water blast to provide a minimum 3/4-in. clearance using a \n15-lb. max chipping hammer. Clean all exposed reinforcing steel, scarified surfaces, and newly exposed \nconcrete surfaces including construction joints against curbs or parapet walls by wet or dry abrasive blasting. \nBlast corroded reinforcing steel to gray metal. Remove and place all blast debris at an approved disposal \nsite. Repair or replace damaged reinforcing steel as required. \nPlace, support, and tie new reinforcing steel on prepared surface in accordance with Item 440 when shown \non the plans. \nComplete surface preparation within 48 hr. of overlay placement. Multiple mobilizations may be required and \nwill be subsidiary to this Item. If placement does not occur due to weather or other scheduling conflicts, \npressure wash deck surface using at least 5,000-psi pressure washer. \n4.4. Placing and Finishing Concrete. Grade the screed rails or headers to ensure the concrete is finished to the \nrequired profile. Place the rails or headers outside the area to be overlaid unless otherwise approved. \nProvide anchorage of headers or supporting rails for horizontal and vertical stability as necessary. A \nhold-down device anchored into the concrete will not be permitted unless the concrete is to be subsequently \noverlaid. Obtain approval for plans for anchor support of headers or rails before beginning work. \nProvide the overlay thickness shown on the plans. Adjust the screed and screed rail as necessary to provide \nthe approved grade and required thickness. Check the clearance between the screed and existing surface \nfor nonreinforced overlays by attaching a filler block with a thickness of 1/8 in. less than the overlay thickness \nto the bottom of the screed. Pass the screed over the area to be overlaid with the filler block in place. Correct \nany areas with insufficient clearance by adjusting the screed and rail system or by chipping or scarifying as \napproved. Check screed clearance and reinforcement cover for reinforced overlays as approved. Clean \nareas where removal occurs by pressure washing using at least 5,000 psi.  \nConstruct longitudinal joints at locations shown on the plans or as approved. Construct a straight and vertical \nedge at transverse and longitudinal construction joints. Saw joints before placing the adjacent overlay \ncourse. \nInstall expansion joints in the overlay at the same locations as the expansion joints in the deck. Do not saw \noverlay to re-establish expansion joint conditions. Isolation forming of expansion joints for overlays is \nrequired. \nProvide clean surface before moistening surface to receive overlay by water blasting to remove all dust, \nspent abrasives, laitance, and other contaminants that can reduce bond strength of overlay to concrete \nsurface. Pressure wash the deck surface using at least 5,000 psi within 48 hr. before CO placement. Cover \ndeck surface to receive CO with polyethylene sheeting to maintain moisture. The plastic sheeting will be \nrolled up as the overlay placement equipment passes over it so that the cleaned surface is not exposed to \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n629 \nwheels, dirt, oil, grease, or any other contaminants. Clean contaminated areas and areas exposed for more \nthan 36 hr. again as directed. Maintain SSD condition for at least 8 hr. before overlay placement.  \nMoisten the prepared surface to a near-SSD condition before placing the overlay concrete. Remove standing \nwater from the surface before placing the overlay concrete. \nDo not use bonding grout unless otherwise shown on the plans or in accordance with this Item. When \nbonding grout is required, moisten the prepared surface to a near-SSD condition before placing bonding \ngrout. Scrub a thin coating of grout into the prepared surface immediately before placing the concrete. \nEnsure all surfaces including vertical joints receive a thorough, even coating and no excess grout collects in \npockets. Apply the grout so it does not become dry before it is covered with concrete. \nAdditional surface preparation and placement of similar approved material will be required in areas where \nContractor’s forming operations or other actions prohibit the placement of overlay concurrently with initial \nphasing. \nPlace and mechanically strike off the overlay concrete slightly above the final grade. Follow this strike-off by \nmechanically consolidating and screeding the surface to the final grade. Vibrate all concrete into the corners \nand angles of the edges. Adequately consolidate overlay material around exposed reinforcing steel. \nHand-finish the surface with a float as necessary to produce a tight, uniform surface. \nAssure dense, watertight construction joints by properly consolidating the concrete and float-finishing the top \nsurface of the joint flush with the adjacent concrete. \nMeet the straightedge and finishing requirements in accordance with Section 422.4.7., “Finish and Interim \nCuring of Bridge Slabs,” for the finishing of the CO. \n4.5. Curing. Apply wet burlap to cure the overlay as soon as possible after the concrete has been textured. \nOverlay that dries out or cracks before the wet burlap is applied will be rejected. Keep the burlap \ncontinuously wet for 48 hr. for LMCs and for 4 days for COs. Allow LMC to air-cure for an additional 48 hr. \nbefore opening to traffic. Water-cure the CO in accordance with Section 422.4.8., “Final Curing,” for an \nadditional 4 days. Do not place traffic on overlay until required strength is obtained. Maintain the surface \ntemperature of the concrete above 40°F for the required curing period. Remove and replace rejected overlay \nconcrete at no additional cost to the Department. \n4.6. Final Surface Texture. Provide final surface texture to hardened concrete surface in accordance with \nSection 422.4.11, “Final Surface Texture.” \n5.

Any deviations \nfrom the application in accordance with this specification must be approved. \n5.1.5. Technical Support Representative. Submit name and qualifications of overlay system manufacturer’s \nrepresentative who will be on the jobsite at initiation of work. The Engineer may request the manufacturer’s \nrepresentative return to the jobsite to address issues that may arise during the work. \n5.2. Handling of Materials. Transport and store polymer materials in their original containers in conformance \nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations and requirements. Clearly mark containers as “Part A—Contains \nResin” or “Part B—Contains Curing Agent,” and include the following information on each container: \n name of product, \n name and address of manufacturer, \n mixing proportions and instructions, \n lot and batch numbers, \n date manufactured, and \n quantity contained. \nStore aggregates in a clean and moisture-free atmosphere that is protected from all potential sources of \ncontamination. \n5.3. Deck Repair. Repair the deck in accordance with Item 429 before surface preparation and as shown on the \nplans. Use only repair materials that are compatible with the crack sealant and overlay systems that the \nsystem manufacturer has determined. Do not use phosphate-based repair materials unless the overlay \nsystem manufacturer determines them to be compatible. \n5.4. Surface Preparation. Prepare the entire concrete deck surface after all repairs have cured in conformance \nwith the repair material manufacturer’s recommendations by removing weak concrete, asphaltic materials, \noils, dirt, rubber, curing compound, paint, carbonation, laitance, weak surface mortar, and other potentially \ndetrimental materials that, in the opinion of the overlay system manufacturer’s representative or the \nEngineer, would prevent proper bonding to or curing of the overlay material. Use power-driven hand tools \nonly in areas where mechanical surface preparation equipment cannot reach. Conduct all hand tool \noperations before using mechanical surface preparation equipment. Select a surface preparation technique \nsuch as size and flow of abrasive or water pressure, travel speed, and number of passes that will provide a \nsurface profile equivalent to International Concrete Repair Institute Guide No. 03732, Profile 5 or higher. Use \nadvanced surface removal methods in accordance with Item 483 when shown on the plans. \nUse compressed air equipment to clean all dust, debris, and concrete fines from the deck surface and \nvertical faces of curbs and barrier walls up to a height of 1 in. above the overlay after hand tool and \nmechanical surface preparation is complete. \nDo not allow public traffic onto any portion of the deck that has been prepared and cleaned, or onto any area \nwhere all courses have not been placed and allowed to fully cure. Overlay application equipment only is \nallowed to drive on the prepared deck surface or on any intermediate course during the overlay application if \nthese surfaces are not contaminated or otherwise damaged. \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n631 \nProtect all prepared surfaces from subsequent contamination, and remove any contamination found on the \ndeck or intermediate courses after initial preparation. The deck surfaces will be inspected for presence of \ncontaminants immediately before placing sealant or any course of the overlay system. Apply the sealant or \nfirst course of the overlay within 24 hr. of surface preparation and place all intermediate courses of the \noverlay within 7 days of initial surface preparation. \n5.5. Tensile Adhesion Testing. Conduct direct pull-off tests in accordance with ASTM C1583 to determine the \nadequacy of the selected surface preparation (e.g., size of shot, flow of shot, forward speed of blast \nmachinery, number of passes, and blast pressure) and cleaning methods. Conduct these tests when the \nsurface temperature is below 80°F. Core through the test overlay to a depth of 0.5 in.    into the underlying \nconcrete. \nConduct one tensile adhesion test for each span or 500 sq. yd., whichever is smaller. The Engineer will \ndetermine test site locations for each representative portion of deck. In addition to representative portion \ntests, the Department may require additional tensile adhesion tests on areas inaccessible to mechanical \nsurface preparation equipment. The Contractor must remove residual test materials adhering to the deck, \nmake necessary adjustments to the surface preparation methods, and retest all representative portions with \nfailing test results, at no additional cost to the Department, until one passing tensile adhesion test result (from \nthree pull-off tests) is obtained for each area tested. \nOne tensile adhesion test result is the average of three pull-off tests conducted over a 1 × 3-ft. test site \nprepared with at least one layer of polymer. Surfaces with tension adhesion test results demonstrating \naverage tensile bond strengths of at least 250 psi are considered acceptable. \n5.6. Application of Polymer Overlay. Do not place polymer overlay on new hydraulic cement concrete that is \nless than 28 days old unless otherwise approved. Place polymer overlay on repairs only after completion of \ncuring of the repair material and with the concurrence, in writing, of the polymer overlay system \nmanufacturer. Allow the deck to dry fully before applying polymer overlay. Identify moisture in the deck using \na plastic sheet left taped in place for at least 2 hr. (in accordance with ASTM D4263) or by other approved \nmethods. Remove all loose sand or aggregate and attain approval before placement of each polymer overlay \ncourse. \nMix, place, and cure the polymer overlay materials in conformance with the overlay system manufacturer’s \nwritten recommendations. Do not apply polymer overlay if the ambient air temperature is expected to drop \nbelow the overlay system manufacturer’s recommended application temperature range within 8 hr. after \napplication or if the gel time is expected to drop below 10 min.  \nBroadcast aggregate onto the still fluid resin binder until a dry layer of aggregate is present over the entire \nsurface. Immediately broadcast additional aggregate until a dry surface is established if wet spots develop. \nAccomplish all aggregate broadcasting while binder is still fluid. Cure each course of overlay until vacuuming \nor sweeping can be conducted without tearing or otherwise damaging the overlay surface. Repair at no \nadditional cost to the Department any intermediate courses in which the treated surface is damaged, is \ncontaminated, or does not receive adequate aggregate before gelling to create an intermediate surface \ncompatible with the next overlay course as the overlay system manufacturer determines. Repair damaged \nareas in conformance with the overlay system manufacturer’s recommendations at no additional cost to the \nDepartment if the final polymer overlay surface is damaged or marred. \nThe nominal finished overlay thickness is at least 3/8 in. measured from the highest point on the deck \nsurface to the peaks of the aggregate. Apply the polymer with aggregates in multiple courses (at least two for \nepoxy systems) as prescribed by the overlay system manufacturer but at rates no less than shown in \nTable 7. Stagger and overlap longitudinal joints between successive courses so no ridges form. \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n632 \nTable 7 \nPolymer and Aggregate Application Rates \nCourse \nPolymer  \n(gal./100 sq. ft.) \nAggregate  \n(lb./sq. yd.) \nEpoxy 1 Not less than 2.5 >10 \nEpoxy 2 Not less than 5.0 >14 \nProtect all bridge deck expansion joints from intrusion of polymer overlay materials. Remove overlay over all \nexpansion joints within 12 hr. of application and before opening the overlay surface to traffic. Removal may \nbe accomplished by scoring the overlay before gelling, by saw-cutting after curing, or by other method \napproved by the overlay system manufacturer. \nObtain approval to open any course to traffic. Obtain approval of cleaning and surface preparation methods \nfor initial courses that were opened to traffic before the final course was applied. Do not allow construction \ntraffic on the final course until it has cured enough to prevent damage by wheel loads. Minimum curing \nperiods will be in accordance with the submitted curing time chart. \n5.7. Repair of Defects. The Department will examine the completed work for defects. Immediately repair or take \ncorrective action for delaminations, raveling, weathering, incomplete aggregate coverage, or other defects \nfound during the Department’s examination. \n6.

Any deviations from the \napplication in accordance with this specification must be approved. \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n633 \n6.1.5. Technical Support Representative. Submit name and qualifications of overlay system manufacturer’s \nrepresentative who will be on the jobsite at initiation of work. The Engineer may request the manufacturer’s \nrepresentative return to the jobsite to address issues that may arise during the work. \n6.2. Handling of Materials. Transport and store polymer materials in their original containers in conformance \nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations and requirements. Clearly mark containers by component and \ncorresponding to sequence of work and include the following information on each container: \n name of product, \n name and address of manufacturer, \n mixing proportions and instructions, \n lot and batch numbers, \n date manufactured, and \n quantity contained. \nStore all materials in a cool, dry location protected from all potential sources of contamination or moisture \nand in their original containers in conformance with the system manufacturer’s recommendation to ensure \ntheir preservation until used in the work. The shelf life for liquid materials stored out of direct sunlight and at \ntemperatures 80°F and below must be at least 12 mo. Applicable fire codes may require special storage \nfacilities for some components of the overlay system.  \n6.3. Application. When night work is necessary, no additional compensation will be provided for night \nplacements of concrete. Provide enough lighting to make quality workmanship and adequate inspection \npossible during night placements. Lighting must be approved before operations begin.  \n6.3.1. Trial Application. Before constructing the overlay, conduct one or more trial applications on the prepared \nsubstrate to demonstrate proper initial set time and the effectiveness of the surface preparation, mixing, \nplacing, and finishing equipment proposed. Each trial application will be at least 10 ft. long, at the planned \npaving width and specified overlay thickness, and on the deck to be overlaid. The Engineer will approve the \nlocations of the trial applications. As approved, successful trial applications may be retained as the final \nproduct.  \nIf the cleaning practice, materials, installation, finishing, or texturing are not acceptable, remove the failed \ntrial application and reinstall the trial application at no additional cost to the Department until satisfactory \nresults are obtained.  \nConduct as many trial applications as necessary to demonstrate the ability to construct an acceptable trial \noverlay section and competency to perform the work. The installer, system provider, and proposed \nequipment and techniques may be rejected if not shown to be acceptable after three failed trial applications.  \nPerform tensile adhesion test 24 hr. after the placement of the trial application in accordance with \nASTM C1583 to assure that the overlay adheres to the prepared surface. Report the average of three \nsuccessful tests. Test cores must be drilled through the overlay and into the substrate at least 0.5 in.  \nThe minimum bond strength on normal weight concrete substrates will be 250 psi with a concrete substrate \nfailure area greater than 50% of the test area. Repair all bond strength test locations with polyester concrete \nin accordance with this Item. \n6.3.2. Surface Preparation. Prepare surface by shot blasting in accordance with Item 483. Remove dirt, slurry, \ncuring compound, laitance, and any other de-bonding material from the surface of the concrete. Keep \nvehicular traffic from shot-blasted surface unless required by the overlay operation and approved. Clean \nconcrete substrates that have contaminants that may interfere with the bonding or curing of the overlay \nbefore placing the overlay, at no additional cost to the Department. Apply primer and overlay only to clean \nand dry concrete substrate.  \n\n2024 Specifications  439 \n634 \nAll steel surfaces that will be in contact with the overlay must be cleaned in accordance with \nSSPC-SP No. 10, “Near-White Blast Cleaning,” except that wet blasting methods are not allowed. \n6.3.3. Application of Primer. Do not begin application of the primer until the substrate is visibly surface dry, free of \nwater and moisture. ASTM D4263 modified for 2 hr. may be used to verify dryness at the discretion of the \nEngineer in cases when surface dryness is difficult to determine.  \nThe substrate surface temperature must be between 40 and 100°F at the time of primer and overlay \nplacement. Night work may be required when temperatures cannot be met during the day.  \nBefore applying the HMWM prime coat, ensure the area is completely dry and blown clean using oil-free \ncompressed air.  \nMix and apply primer in conformance with the system provider’s recommendations. Apply primer within \n5 min. of mixing initiator and resin at a rate of approximately 90–100 sq. ft./gal. or as otherwise \nrecommended by the system provider. Apply primer by flooding and uniformly spreading to completely cover \nall surfaces to receive overlay, including any adjacent vertical surfaces. Avoid heavy application that results \nin excess puddling. Remove or distribute excess material to meet the recommended application rate. \nReapply primer to any areas that appear visibly dry before overlay placement. \n6.3.4. Application of Polyester Concrete. Mix and apply the polyester concrete in conformance with the system \nprovider’s recommendations. Place concrete only when the air or substrate temperature is between 40°F \nand 100°F and the polyester concrete temperature is between 40°F and 100°F.  \nApply polyester concrete after 15 min. and within 2 hr. of placing the primer. Place the polyester concrete \nbefore gelling or within 15 min. following addition of the initiator, whichever occurs first, or as recommended \nby the system provider.  \nThe polyester concrete mixture must have an initial set time of 30–90 min. Initial set has occurred when the \nin-place polyester concrete cannot be deformed by pressing with a finger. An initial set of less than 20 min. \nwill be cause for rejection at the Engineer’s discretion. If the initial set is not within 90 min., remove and \nreplace the material at no additional cost.  \nConsolidate and finish the polyester concrete using placement equipment as defined herein to strike off the \npolyester concrete to the required grade and cross-section as shown on the plans.  \nPlace the polyester overlay at a profile necessary to meet the desired grade and cross-section as shown on \nthe plans, with a minimum thickness of 3/4 in. Termination edges of the overlay may require application and \nfinishing by hand trowel due to obstructions such as a curb. Isolate expansion joints before overlaying or saw \nwithin 4 hr. after overlay placement, as approved.  \nProvide enough labor and equipment for proportioning, mixing, placing, and finishing CO at a rate of at least \n40 ft. of finished overlay per hour.  \n6.3.5. Application of Abrasive Sand Finish. Apply the abrasive finish sand evenly on the finished overlay surface \nat a rate of at least 2.2 lb. per square yard by broadcasting immediately after the overlay placement before \ngelling. Adjust rate of application as necessary to ensure complete coverage. \n6.4. Curing. Cure overlay sufficiently before being subjected to loads or traffic of any nature that may damage the \noverlay. Cure time depends on ambient and substrate temperatures and also initiator and accelerator levels \nused at the time of mixing. The overlay is considered cured to a traffic-ready state after 4 hr. following \nfinishing, or as approved by manufacturer and the Engineer. Methods to validate traffic-ready state in less \nthan 4 hr. may be submitted by the manufacturer for approval.

Replace rejected material promptly. \n3.1.9. Material Identification. Assembly-mark individual pieces and issue cutting instructions to the shop using a \nsystem that will maintain identity of the original piece. \nIdentify structural steel by standard and grade of steel. Also differentiate between material toughness \nrequirements (CVN or fracture-critical) as well as any other special physical requirements. In addition, \nidentify structural steel for primary members by mill identification numbers (heat numbers). Use an approved \nidentification system. Use either paint or low-stress stencils to make identification markings on the metal. \nMark the material as soon as it enters the shop and carry the markings on all pieces through final fabrication. \nTransfer the markings before cutting steel for primary members of bridge structures into smaller pieces. Loss \nof identification marking on any piece, with no other positive identification, or loss of heat number \nidentification on any primary member piece will render the piece unacceptable for use. Unidentifiable material \nmay be approved for use after testing to establish acceptability to the satisfaction of the Engineer. Have an \napproved testing facility perform testing and a licensed professional engineer sign and seal the results. \nLow-stress stencil marks must have a radius instead of a sharp point.

Field-bolted cross-frames and rolled-section diaphragms do not require shop \nassembly. Complete fabrication, welding (except for shear studs), and field splice preparation before \nmembers are removed from shop assembly. Obtain approval for any deviation from this procedure. The \nContractor is responsible for accurate geometry. \nUse a method and details of preassembly consistent with the erection procedure shown on the erection plans \nand camber diagrams. The sequence of assembly may start from any location in the structure and proceed in \none or both directions. An approved method of sequential geometry control is required unless the full length \nof the structure is assembled. \nVerify by shop assembly the fit of all bolted and welded field connections between bent cap girders and plate \ngirders or between plate girders and floor beams. \nDo not measure horizontal curvature and vertical camber for final acceptance until all welding and heating \noperations are completed and the steel has cooled to a uniform temperature. Check horizontal curvature and \nvertical camber in a no-load condition. \n3.7.2. Bolted Field Connections. Each shop assembly, including camber, alignment, accuracy of holes, and fit of \nmilled joints, must be approved before the assembly is dismantled. \nAssemble with milled ends of compression members in full bearing. Assemble non-bearing connections to \nthe specified gap. Ream all subsize holes to the specified size while the connections are assembled, or drill \nfull size while the connections are assembled. Notify the Engineer before shipping if fill plates or shims are \nadded. Adding or increasing the thickness of shims or fill plates in bearing connections requires approval. \nUse drift pins and snug-tight bolts during the drilling process to ensure all planes of the connection (webs and \nflanges) can be assembled simultaneously. Do not use tack welds to secure plates while drilling. \nSecure parts not completely bolted in the shop with temporary bolts to prevent damage in shipment and \nhandling. Never use tack welds in place of temporary bolts. \nMatch-mark connecting parts in field connections using low-stress stencils in conformance with the diagram \non the erection drawings. \n3.7.3. Welded Field Connections. Mill or grind bevels for groove welds. Do not cut into the web when cutting the \nfla nge bevel adjacent to the web. End preparation, backing, and tolerances for girder splices must be in \naccordance with Item 448. Details for all other field welds must conform to the applicable AWS code unless \notherwise shown on the plans. \nIn the shop, prepare ends of beams or girders to be field-welded taking into account their relative positions in \nthe finished structure due to grade, camber, and curvature. Completely shop-assemble and check each \nsplice. Match-mark the splice while it is assembled with low-stress stencils in conformance with the diagram \non the erection drawings. \n3.8. Finish and Painting. \n3.8.1. Shop Painting.

Submit a plan that details the procedures and type and size of equipment proposed to keep \npublic property, private property, and the environment from being adversely affected by the cleaning and \npainting operations. Approval of the plan is required before cleaning and painting operations begin. \nContainment is not required for painting new steel erected under Item 441 that is not erected or installed onto \nan existing steel structure other than to comply with Section 446.4.5., “Cleaning and Painting New Steel.” \nWhen shown on the plans, include with the containment plan an engineering analysis showing that the loads \nadded to the existing structure by the containment system and waste materials do not result in overstress of \nthe members.  Have a licensed professional engineer sign, seal, and date the submittal. \nProvide containment during all cleaning and painting operations of existing steel structures. Obtain approval \nof the constructed containment system before beginning cleaning and painting. \nConstruct and maintain a structure meeting the following minimum requirements: \n AMPP Guide 6, Class 1A, Level 1 emissions; \n ability to withstand winds up to 30 mph; \n enclosure of all sides of area with air-impenetrable walls; \n illumination meeting AMPP Guide 12; \n rigid and solid, watertight floor formed from minimum 20-gauge steel; \n overlapping seams and entryways; and \n exhaust air filtration system capable of creating negative pressure inside the enclosure, causing the \nsides of the containment to have a concave appearance and demonstrating minimum 100-ft. per minute \ncross-draft airflow and minimum 50-ft. per minute downdraft airflow in all areas within the containment. \nIn place of a full containment structure, a modified containment system may be proposed for the following \nsituations: \n when using abrasive blasting equipment with negative pressure able to contain all blast refuse. \nDemonstrate, for approval, the equipment’s ability to contain all blast refuse. \n when tool cleaning and water blasting for spot cleaning only, provide a system that will contain all \nremoved paint, rust, and other debris. Place an airtight membrane below the member being cleaned to \ncollect all falling debris and wastewater. \n when using power hand tools for spot cleaning only that are equipped with high-efficiency particulate air \n(HEPA) filter vacuums that will capture all removed paint, rust, and other debris. Otherwise, provide an \nairtight membrane below the member being cleaned to collect all falling debris. \nProvide a system meeting AMPP Guide 6, Class 1W, when using water blasting. Manage wastewater from \nwater blasting in accordance with Section 446.4.8.2., “Wastewater.” \nProvide safe access to all parts of the work for proper inspection. When a temporary facility is proposed for \ninspection access, provide a plan for review. This facility requires a licensed professional engineer in \naccordance with Article 5.2, “Plans and Working Drawings,” Table 1. Do not place rigging or scaffolds in \n\n2024 Specifications  446 \n667 \ncontact with previously painted surfaces until the previously applied coating has fully cured. Protect \npreviously painted and cured surfaces using an approved padding to minimize damage when rigging or \nscaffolds will be placed on or hung from those surfaces. Avoid and minimize coating damage to the extent \npossible. Repair all coating damaged by rigging or scaffolding as directed. \nRemove tree limbs, bushes, grass, and other items that will interfere with the cleaning and painting \noperations as directed. Remove vertical clearance signs, and erect and maintain temporary ground-mounted \nsigns matching the content and letter size on the existing sign unless otherwise directed. Re-attach \npermanent clearance signs as directed. \nUse a skimmer when cleaning and painting over bodies of water. Remove any blast or paint material the \nskimmer collects the day the release occurs. Correct the containment problem that allowed the release \nbefore continuing work. \nEnsure air is clear of dust and remove all blast refuse from cleaned members before the Inspector enters the \ncontainment to inspect the cleaned surfaces. Remove all blast refuse from the containment before ending \nwork for the day. \n4.6.3. Preparation of Surfaces. Prepare surfaces before applying paint. \n4.6.3.1. General Preparation. Ensure all surfaces to be painted are completely free of all visible contaminants \nincluding but not limited to oil, grease, moisture, dirt, sand, overspray, and welding contamination (slag or \nacid residue); loose or flaking mill scale, rust, or paint; weld spatter; and any other conditions that will prevent \nthe paint from forming a continuous, uniform, tightly adhering film.  \nBefore other cleaning operations, remove grease-like contaminants using clean petroleum solvents or other \napproved methods. Contain solvents and removed material as approved. Dispose of properly or reuse \nsolvents as approved. \nRemove all hackles, splinters, weld spatter, sharp edges, fins, slag, or other irregularities that may interfere \nwith proper paint adhesion to the steel. Remove all steel splinters (hackles) raised or evident during cleaning. \nRound all corners and edges to a 1/16-in. radius. Abrasive blast areas from which hackles and irregularities \nare removed and edges that have been rounded to achieve a minimum 1.5-mil profile. Grind all flame-cut \nedges when necessary to produce a minimum 1.5-mil profile over the entire flame-cut surface to achieve \nadequate coating adhesion. \nRemove all pack rust and expansive rust between steel plates and in crevices using either abrasive blasting, \nultra-high pressure waterjetting (UHP), heated water, or other approved methods. \nEnsure all surfaces to be painted meet the minimum non-visible contaminant level established by the coating \nmanufacturer or in accordance with AMPP-SP 12, NV-2, whichever is more stringent. Perform soluble salt \ncontamination tests in accordance with AMPP Technology Guide 15, “Field Methods for Retrieval and \nAnalysis of Soluble Salts on Steel and Other Nonporous Substrates,” immediately before paint application of \neach coat to determine whether salt contamination has occurred. If a method other than Class A is used, \nthen it must first be validated against the Class A method before adopting structure-wide. Test at least four \nrandom locations every 1,000 sq. ft. If soluble salt levels exceed maximum requirements, provide additional \nwater blast cleaning to remove salt contamination (or recontamination) and retest the area. If additional water \nblasting does not reduce the concentration to the acceptable level, a surface treatment or water additive may \nbe used. Use a surface treatment or water additive that is approved by the coating system supplier and the \nEngineer. All salt test results must be preserved and made accessible to the Engineer. \nClean coated surfaces by an approved method that does not damage applied paint to remove all dirt, grease, \nconcrete, overspray, and any other substance that may impair adhesion before the application of the next \ncoat. \nClean far enough into any shop-applied paint to ensure removal of all contaminants.  \n\n2024 Specifications  446 \n668 \nFeather edges of sound paint around spot-cleaned areas. Feather all sound, tightly adhered coating edges \nsurrounding cleaned or repaired areas at least 1 in., and ensure a smooth, blended transition. \nCompletely remove, as directed, the protective coating on machined surfaces and pins. \nDo not damage adjacent materials such as concrete during surface preparation or painting. \n4.6.3.2. Classes of Cleaning. Water blast to remove contaminants before any mechanical or abrasive surface \npreparation. Water blast the steel and between coats when necessary to remove non-visible contamination. \nSystem I requires tool cleaning for defective areas of disbonded coating or rust. All other paint systems \nrequire abrasive blast cleaning unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nPrepare all surfaces of painted steel members subsequently exposed from structural operations, such as \ndeck removal or steel repair, in accordance with this Item. Prevent loose or damaged paint from entering the \nenvironment. \n4.6.3.2.1. Abrasive Blast Cleaning. Meet the surface preparation requirements in accordance with AMPP-SP 10 \nunless otherwise shown on the plans. Ensure a minimum profile of 1.5 mils. Do not add depth to existing \nprofile when the surface profile exceeds 4.0 mils. Measure surface profile in accordance with ASTM D4417, \nMethod C. Containment mounting points and other repair areas under 1 sq. ft. may be tool-cleaned to \nAMPP-SP 11 with at least a minimum 1.5-mil profile when approved. \nFor existing steel structures, use an abrasive recycling system with an approved recyclable abrasive unless \notherwise shown on the plans. New steel erected under Item 441 that is not erected or installed onto an \nexisting steel structure is excluded from the recyclable abrasive requirement. Do not use steel shot. Abrasive \nwill be considered recyclable if it is separated from the dust and paint debris before being reused. A non-\nrecyclable abrasive may be used when the coating system has been identified as nonhazardous as shown \non the plans. All abrasives must meet AMPP AB1, AB2, or AB3 as appropriate.  \n4.6.3.2.2. Tool Cleaning. Meet the requirements of AMPP-SP 11 unless otherwise shown on the plans. Probe the \nperimeter of peeled areas of paint using a putty knife to ensure remaining paint is tightly adhered. \n4.6.3.2.3. Water Blasting. Meet the requirements of AMPP-SP WJ-4. Tight mill scale and tightly adhered rust and \npaint are permitted. Probe the perimeter of peeled areas of paint using a putty knife to ensure remaining \npaint is tightly adhered.  \n4.6.3.3. Tape Test. Perform the tape test, as necessary to determine cleanliness, on any surface before painting as \nfollows: \n Press a strip of filament tape onto the surface by rubbing using moderate thumb pressure four times, \nleaving approximately 2 in. of one end of the tape free from the surface. \n Grasp the free end and remove the tape from the surface using a sharp pull. \nThe surface will be considered contaminated and not adequately cleaned if visible particles cling to the tape. \n4.6.4. Painting. \n4.6.4.1. Paint Condition. Thoroughly mix and strain paints to be applied in conformance with the manufacturer’s \nrecommendations. Mix by mechanical methods. Provide continuous mechanical agitation during painting \noperations to prevent settling. Ensure the paint is a completely homogeneous mixture free of lumps, skins, \nand agglomerates and contains all pigments, vehicle solids, and thinners required in the original formulation. \nKeep paint containers tightly covered and protected from weather when not in use. \n4.6.4.2. Thinning. Adjust paint to the correct application consistency in conformance with the manufacturer’s \nrecommendations. \n\n2024 Specifications  446 \n669 \n4.6.4.3. Paint System Requirements.

SPS. Apply paint as shown on the plans.  \n4.6.4.7. Application. Do not apply paint when the steel or air temperature is below 50°F or when the steel or air \ntemperature is expected to drop below 50°F within 2 hr. after application, unless otherwise approved. Do not \n\n2024 Specifications  446 \n670 \napply paint to any surface with discernible moisture. Do not apply paint to any surface when steel is within \n5°F of the dewpoint. Do not apply paint when impending weather conditions might result in damage to fresh \npaint. \nProvide environmental controls such as dehumidification, heaters, or additional containment measures as \nneeded to control and maintain favorable atmospheric conditions in all areas of the containment. Provide \nenvironmental controls at no additional cost to the Department. \nApply each coat in two passes using a crosshatch pattern. Apply each coat of paint to clean, dry, firm \nsurfaces in accordance with all specification requirements. Ensure each coat fully cures to form a smooth, \ncontinuous, tightly adhering film of uniform thickness and appearance and free of defects before applying the \nnext coat. Apply all coats by spray, except brush-applied stripe coats. Obtain approval for alternative \nmethods of application to paint inaccessible areas. \nRepair all runs, sags, and other defects in each coat of paint before application of subsequent coats. \nMeasure the dry film thickness of coatings in accordance with AMPP PA 2, Level 3, “Procedure for \nDetermining Conformance to Dry Coating Thickness Requirements.” \nIf, in the opinion of the Engineer, there is an objectionable amount of dust in the atmosphere, discontinue \npainting or take necessary precautions to prevent dust and dirt from contacting freshly painted surfaces or \nsurfaces before the paint is applied. \nProvide full coverage of the steel with the concrete surface when painting steel that is in contact with \nconcrete. Do not extend paint more than 4 in. onto the concrete surfaces or as directed. Ensure when \npainting is completed the only visible paint on concrete surfaces is the finish coat. Remove excessive or \nobjectionable paint on concrete surfaces in an approved manner. Intermediate and appearance coats do not \nhave to be applied to surfaces that will be in full contact with concrete. Before applying the appearance coat \nonto existing steel structures, caulk gaps or crevices greater than 1/16 inch. New steel erected under \nItem 441 that is not erected or installed onto an existing steel structure is excluded from the caulking \nrequirement. Use a paintable caulk meeting the requirements of DMS-8142\n, “Paintable Caulk for Concrete \nand Steel.” Use caulk that is compatible with the coatings to be applied, as determined by coating \nmanufacturer. Apply caulking in a manner that does not trap moisture. \n4.6.4.8. Workmanship. Perform all painting using skilled painters who can adjust equipment and application \ntechniques as dictated by the type of paint, weather conditions, environment, and size and shape of the \nsurface being painted. Painters who, in the opinion of the Engineer, do not adjust equipment to apply \ncoatings in a uniform, full wet coat free of runs, sags, holidays, and overspray will not be considered skilled \npainters and may be removed from the project. \nBrush application for touchup is acceptable if the paint is mixed in the appropriate proportions by weight and \nis agitated continuously during the painting operation. \n4.6.5. Handling and Shipping. Pad the blocks, chains, slings, braces, and clamps used for handling, moving, \nstoring, and shipping painted members so the paint will not be damaged. \n4.7. Paint Improperly Applied. To uncover evidence of improperly applied paint, the Engineer may at any time \nduring construction explore underneath the surface of any paint coats already applied. Repair these areas of \ninvestigation at no additional expense to the Department. Whenever unsatisfactory conditions are found, the \nEngineer may require remedial measures. \nRepair or completely remove and replace all paint that has been applied improperly, has been applied to \nimproperly cleaned surfaces, fails to dry and harden properly, fails to adhere tightly to underlying metal or \nother paint film, or does not have a normal, workmanlike appearance in accordance with this Item. When the \nfinal field coat does not have a uniform color and appearance throughout the structure, correct it using \nwhatever additional coats or other corrective measures are required. Remove freshly applied paint that has \n\n2024 Specifications  446 \n671 \nnot yet set using suitable solvents. Remove dried paint films by blast cleaning, scraping, or flame torches, as \napproved. \n4.8. Waste and Wastewater. Manage all waste and wastewater generated by cleaning and painting operations \nas necessary to prevent unauthorized release into the environment. \n4.8.1. Waste. At minimum, collect all waste before leaving the jobsite each day. Handle and store the waste as if it \nwere hazardous or Universal Waste until classification is made. Follow the requirements of 30 TAC § 335 for \nonsite handling of the waste. Store waste collected in containers that comply with 49 CFR Part 178. Seal \ncontainers containing waste each day before leaving the jobsite. \nTest a representative sample of waste in accordance with EPA Test Method 1311, “Toxicity Characteristic \nLeaching Procedure” (TCLP), to determine existing metal and organic content. Handle and dispose of \nnonhazardous waste as a “Special Waste” as defined in 30 TAC § 330.2 or as directed. Provide \ndocumentation showing disposal of the waste was in a suitable landfill holding permits to handle this type of \nmaterial. Dispose of hazardous waste in conformance with applicable waste rules and regulations. Transport \nhazardous waste using a permitted transporter and dispose of it in an authorized hazardous waste facility. \nWhen the plans show the existing coating to be removed contains hazardous materials and steel grit is used \nas the abrasive, the waste generated is classified as hazardous or Universal Waste regardless of the results \nof the TCLP. For manifesting purposes, the Department is considered the waste generator for paint removal \nwastes generated from structures owned or controlled by the State. Dispose of this waste in conformance \nwith applicable waste rules and regulations as specified above and in accordance with the Contract. \nProvide copies of all test reports and transportation manifests to the Engineer before shipping waste. Provide \nsigned original manifests to the Engineer verifying all steps of the handling and disposal process were \ncorrectly handled. \n4.8.2. Wastewater. Avoid unauthorized discharge of wastewater to streams or other surface waters. Contain and \ndispose of all wastewater to a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), with written approval from the \nPOTW, or at a permitted commercial disposal facility, unless authorization for reuse or discharge is obtained \nfrom TCEQ and approved. Wastewater from cleaning operations of new steel erected under Item 441 that \nmeets the TCEQ Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES) Construction General Permit \n(CGP) TXR150000 guidelines for non-stormwater discharge may be discharged in accordance with best \nmanagement practices described in the site Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SW3P). \n4.9.

Do not tension bolts that have been installed snug-\ntight in the shop. Remove any bolts installed snug-tight in the shop and replace them with new bolts. Inspect \nand prepare the joint surfaces after removing shop-installed bolts that are not fully tensioned in the shop. \nProvide a hardened washer for heavy-hex and tension-control bolts under either the nut or the bolt head, \nwhichever is turned during tensioning. Install hardened washers under both the nut and bolt head of \nGrade A490 bolts when the outer plies being fastened have a yield strength less than 40 ksi. \nInstall an ASTM F436 washer for direct-tension indicators as follows: \n under the nut when the nut is turned and the direct-tension indicator is located under the bolt head, \n between the nut and the direct-tension indicator when the nut is turned and the direct-tension indicator \nis located under the nut, \n under the bolt head when the bolt head is turned and the direct-tension indicator is located under the \nnut, and \n between the bolt head and the direct-tension indicator when the bolt head is turned and the \ndirect-tension indicator is located under the bolt head. \nTension all bolts to provide the minimum bolt tension values shown in Table 2. \nErect steel in accordance with Item 441, “Steel Structures.” Do not tack-weld any parts to eliminate fitup bolts \nor to hold parts together while bolting. \nRemove lubricant from bolt assemblies on painted structures after tensioning and before coating the \nconnections. \nRe-tighten the nuts or tack weld the nuts to the bolts when bolts are used to temporarily support welded \ndiaphragms after completing the welding operations if the diaphragms are over vehicular or pedestrian traffic. \n\n2024 Specifications  447 \n676 \nTable 2 \nBolt Tension \nNominal Bolt Size, in. \nMinimum Tension (kips) \nGrade A325 Bolts Grade A490 Bolts \n1/2 12 15 \n5/8 19 24 \n3/4 28 35 \n7/8 39 49 \n   \n1 51 64 \n1-1/8 64 80 \n1-1/4 81 102 \n1-3/8 97 121 \n   \n1-1/2 118 148 \n4.4. Preparation of Faying Surfaces. Perform blast cleaning or painting of faying surfaces in accordance with \nItem 441. Provide an AMPP-SP 10 blast cleaning before shipment for weathering steel. Do not wire-brush \nweathering steel faying surfaces. \n4.5. Bolt Installation. Use the following procedure for bolt installation of a complete connection. \n4.5.1. Fair-Up Holes. Use a minimum number of erection or drift pins, as directed, in the holes to “fair-up” all holes. \n4.5.2. Install Bolts. Install bolts in all remaining holes of the connection. Do not use excessive force, which could \nresult in damage to the threads, to install the bolts. Increase the number of erection or drift pins as necessary \nto align the holes if force is required to install the bolts. Do not ream the holes unless approved. Ream the \nholes in accordance with Section 441.3.11.5., “Misfits,” if approved. Remove the erection or drift pins and \ninstall bolts in these holes. Bring the connection to a full snug-tight condition by snugging systematically from \nthe most rigid part of the connection to the free edges. The snug-tight condition is defined as the tightness \nthat exists when the plies of the joint are in firm, full contact and all of the bolts in the joint have been \ntightened enough to prevent the removal of the nuts without the use of a wrench. A snug-tight condition can \nusually be attained by a few impacts of an impact wrench or the full effort of a worker using an ordinary spud \nwrench, as demonstrated in the installation verification test. As necessary, re-snug previously snugged bolts \nthat may have relaxed due to the subsequent snugging of adjacent bolts to ensure all bolts are \nsimultaneously snug-tight and the connection plates are in full contact. \nFully tighten a minimum number of bolts as directed until the plies are in full contact if snugging does not \nbring the plies of the joint into full contact. Mark these bolts as fitup bolts. Use a non-galvanized Grade A325 \nbolt of the same diameter as a fitup bolt in connections requiring the use of galvanized Grade A325 bolts. \nRe-snug all remaining bolts. \nDo not use washer-type indicating devices to bring the connection to a snug-tight condition. Rather, install \nheavy-hex bolt assemblies in enough holes (approximately 20%) to attain firm, full contact between plies. \nRemove the heavy-hex bolts and install the washer-type indicating device assemblies after firm contact is \nestablished by connections in surrounding bolt holes. \n4.5.3. Tension Bolts. Loosen all fitup bolts after tensioning all the other bolts in the connection. Ungalvanized \nGrade A325 bolts used as fitup bolts may be reused in a connection using this type of bolt. Replace all \ngalvanized bolts and Grade A490 bolts used as fitup bolts. Tension these remaining untensioned bolts in \naccordance with this Section. Ensure the element not turned by the wrench (bolt head or nut) does not \nrotate. \n4.5.3.1. Turn-of-the-Nut Method. Match-mark the nuts and the protruding bolt ends after the bolts have been \nbrought up to snug-tight condition and before final tensioning so that actual rotation can be determined. \nTension all bolts in the connection to their final tension by the amount of rotation shown in Table 3. Start final \ntensioning at the center or most rigid part of the connection and progress toward the free edges. \n\n2024 Specifications  447 \n677 \n4.5.3.2. Calibrated Wrench Method. Use a calibrated hydraulic torque wrench to tension all bolts to 1.05 times the \ntension shown in Table 2 after they have been brought to the snug-tight condition. Calibrate the wrench in \naccordance with Section 447.3.2.2., “Calibrated Torque Wrenches.” Start tensioning at the most rigid part of \nthe connection and proceed to the free edges. Return the wrench to re-tension previously tensioned bolts \nthat may have relaxed due to the subsequent tensioning of adjacent bolts. Place marks on the socket at \none-third points so the amount of rotation can be visually determined. \n4.5.3.3. Washer-Type Indicating Devices. \n4.5.3.3.1. Compressible-Washer Type,  Direct-Tension Indicators. Ensure the direct-tension indicator arches are \noriented away from the work and that they bear against the hardened bearing surface. Confirm the \nappropriate feeler gauge is accepted in at least half the spaces between protrusions before tensioning and \nrefused entry in at least half the spaces between protrusions after tensioning. \n4.5.3.3.2. Alternative Washer Type Indicating Devices. Follow the procedures prepared by the manufacturer and \napproved. Verify proper installation after tensioning. \n4.5.4. Bolt Reuse. Do not reuse Grade A490 or galvanized Grade A325 bolts. Ungalvanized Grade A325 bolts \nmay be reused once if the threads have not been damaged. Re-tensioning previously tensioned bolts \nloosened by the tensioning of adjacent bolts is not considered to be reuse. \nTension all bolts in a connection within 10 days of installation. Bolts not tensioned within 10 days of \ninstallation are subject to field R-C testing. Re-lubricate or replace any installed bolts that do not have \nenough lubrication as determined by the field R-C test. \nTable 3 \nNut Rotation from Snug-Tight Condition\n1\n \nBolt Length  \n(underside of head to end of \nbolt) \nDisposition of Outer Face of Bolted Parts \nBoth Faces Normal \nto Bolt Axis \nOne Face Normal to Bolt Axis \nand Other Face Sloped Less \nthan 1:20 (beveled washer not \nused) \nBoth Faces Sloped  \nLess than 1:20 from Bolt Axis  \n(beveled washer not used) \nUp to and including 4 bolt \ndiameters \n1/3 turn 1/2 turn 2/3 turn \nOver 4 bolt diameters up to \nand including 8 diameters \n1/2 turn 2/3 turn 5/6 turn \nOver 8 bolt diameters up to \nand including 12 diameters\n2\n \n2/3 turn 5/6 turn 1 turn \n1. Nut rotation is relative regardless of the element (nut or bolt) being turned. The tolerance is –0°, +30° for bolts \ninstalled by 1/2 turn or less and –0°, +45° for bolts installed by 2/3 turn or more. \n2. Determine the required rotation for bolt lengths greater than 12 diameters using the installation verification test in a \nsimulated connection of solidly fitted steel. \n5. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT \nInstallation and testing of bolts will not be paid for directly,  but will be subsidiary to pertinent Items requiring \nthe use of high-strength bolts. \nWhen payment for the structure associated with the bolts is made under Item 442, “Metal for Structures,” \nbolts, nuts, and washers will be paid for in accordance with Item 442. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n678 \n \nItem 448 \nStructural Field Welding \n1.

Furnish certification to the Engineer that the gas or gas mixture is suitable for the intended \napplication and will meet the dew point requirements. \n3. EQUIPMENT \nProvide electrode drying and storing ovens that can maintain the required temperatures specified in \nSection 448.4.3.1., “Electrode Condition.” Each oven must have a door that is sealed and can be latched. \nEach oven must have a small port that may be opened briefly to insert a thermometer,  or the oven must be \nequipped with a thermometer that allows for direct reading of temperature inside the oven without opening \nthe oven. Provide equipment able to preheat and maintain the temperature of the base metal as required and \nas shown on the plans. Provide approved equipment (e.g., temperature indicator sticks or infrared \nthermometer) for checking preheat and interpass temperatures at all times while welding is in progress. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n680 \nProvide welding equipment meeting the requirements of the approved welding procedure specifications \n(WPSs), if required, and capable of making consistent high-quality welds. \n4. CONSTRUCTION \n4.1. Procedure Qualification. Use the proper classification and size of electrode, arc length, voltage, and \namperage for the thickness of the material, type of groove, welding positions, and other circumstances of the \nwork. \nSubmit WPSs for FCAW, qualified in accordance with AASHTO/AWS D1.5 for approval before any field \nwelding on a project. \n4.2. Welder Qualification. Provide Department certification papers for each welder and for each welding process \nto be used before welding, except for miscellaneous welds described in Section 448.4.2.1.1., “Miscellaneous \nWelding Applications.” The Department issues certification as described in Section 448.4.2.2., “Certified \nSteel Structures Welder.” \n4.2.1. Miscellaneous Welding. A qualified welder is an experienced welder who is capable of making welds of \nsound quality but does not have Department certification papers. The Engineer will check the welder’s ability \nby conducting a jobsite test in accordance with Section 448.4.2.1.2., “Miscellaneous Weld Qualification Test,” \nbefore welding begins. Furnish all materials and equipment necessary for this test. \n4.2.1.1. Miscellaneous Welding Applications. A welder certified for structural or reinforcing steel or a qualified \nwelder may make miscellaneous welds of the following types: \n splicing reinforcing steel to extend bars in the bottom of a drilled shaft; \n attaching chairs to the reinforcing steel cage of a drilled shaft; \n armor joints and their supports; \n screed rail and form hanger supports where permitted on steel units; \n reinforcing steel to R-bars for lateral stability between prestressed beams, spirals, or bands to \nreinforcing bars in drilled shaft cages; \n permanent metal deck forms; \n additional steel added in railing when slip-form construction is used; and \n other similar miscellaneous members that have no load-carrying capacity in the completed structure. \n4.2.1.2. Miscellaneous Weld Qualification Test. A qualified welder must pass a jobsite Miscellaneous Weld \nQualification Test before welding. \n Make a single-pass fillet weld of 1/4-in. maximum size in the vertical position approximately 2 in. long on \n1/2-in. plate in the location shown in Figure 1. Use the same electrode proposed for the work. \n The Engineer will visually inspect the fillet weld for a reasonably uniform appearance and then rupture \nthe weld as shown in Figure 2 using force or by striking it with a hammer. \n The fractured surface of the weld will be inspected to ensure complete penetration into the root of the \njoint, complete fusion to the base metal, and no inclusion or porosity larger than 3/32 in. in its greatest \ndimension. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n681 \n \nFigure 1 \nMiscellaneous Qualification—Fillet Weld Break Specimen \n \n \nFigure 2 \nMiscellaneous Qualification—Method of Rupturing Specimen \nA welder who fails the Miscellaneous Weld Qualification Test may retest under the following conditions. \n The retest occurs immediately and consists of two test welds as described above, with both test \nspecimens meeting all the requirements. \n The retest occurs after 30 days if the welder provides evidence of further training or practice. In this \ncase, the test consists of a single test weld. \nQualification by the Miscellaneous Weld Qualification Test is effective immediately upon satisfactory \ncompletion of the test and remains in effect for the duration of a project. \n4.2.2. Certified Steel Structures Welder. Before making non-miscellaneous welds on structural steel, a welder \nmust pass the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 qualification test for groove welds for plates of unlimited thickness in the \nvertical (3G) and overhead (4G) positions with the following additional requirements. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n682 \n Use metal for test plates that meets Item 442, “Metal for Structures,” with a minimum yield point of \n36 ksi. The minimum width of test plate must be sufficient to accommodate the radiograph inspection of \n5-1/4 continuous inches of the weld, not counting the ends of the weld. \n Use approved electrodes meeting the required class in accordance with Table 1 and, in the case of \nFCAW, in conformance with the approved WPS. \n Have a radiographic inspection performed on the weld on each test plate. Any porosity or fusion-type \ndiscontinuity with greatest dimension larger than 1/16 in. found in the weld will result in failure of the \ntest. Discontinuities with greatest dimension less than 1/16 in. are acceptable provided the sum of their \ngreatest dimensions does not exceed 3/8 in. in any inch of weld. \n Have two side-bend specimens prepared, tested, and inspected for each test plate. \nThe test must be administered by an approved laboratory and welding observed by laboratory personnel. \nSubmit two copies of the certification issued by the laboratory, all accompanying test papers, and the \nradiographic films to the Bridge Division for review. The Bridge Division issues Department certification \npapers if the laboratory’s certification is approved. A welder must also demonstrate to the Engineer a \nthorough knowledge of the required welding procedures together with the ability and desire to follow them \nand make welds of sound quality and good appearance. The certification issued by an approved laboratory is \naccepted for 1 mo. from the time of certification, during which time the welder may work on Department \nprojects if the work is satisfactory. Certification papers issued by the Department remain in effect as long as \nthe welder performs acceptable work as determined by the Bridge Division. The certification may be \ncancelled at any time if the welder’s work is not acceptable. \nFor SMAW, a welder certified using EXX18 electrodes is qualified to weld with all approved SMAW \nelectrodes up to E90XX to join metals with a maximum specified yield strength of 65 ksi. \n4.3. Welding Steel Structures. \n4.3.1. Electrode Condition. \n4.3.1.1. SMAW. For electrodes with low-hydrogen coverings in conformance with AWS A5.1, dry to the \nmanufacturer’s written drying instructions or dry for at least 2 hr. between 450°F and 500°F. For electrodes \nwith low-hydrogen coverings conforming to AWS A5.5, dry for at least 1 hr. between 700°F and 800°F or as \nspecified by the electrode manufacturer. If using electrodes from a newly opened, undamaged, hermetically \nsealed container, drying is not required. Store electrodes in ovens held at a temperature of at least 250°F \nimmediately after drying or removal from hermetically sealed container. Elapsed time permitted between \nremoval of an electrode from the storage oven or hermetically sealed container and use of the electrode is \nshown in Table 2. If the electrodes have the moisture resistance designator “R” and are being used on steel \nwith minimum specified yield strength of 50 ksi or less, exposure time may be increased up to 9 hr. \n \nTable 2 \nSMAW Electrode Exposure Limits \nElectrode Type Exposure Time (hr.) \nE70 4 \nE80 2 \nE90 1 \nLeave electrodes in the holding oven for at least 4 hr. at 250°F before reusing if they are placed back in it \nbefore the times shown in Table 2 have lapsed. The Engineer may reduce times allowed for use without re-\ndrying in humid atmospheres. Do not redry electrodes more than once. Do not use electrodes with flux that \nhas been wet, cracked, or otherwise damaged. \n4.3.1.2. FCAW. Protect or store welding wire coils removed from the original package to keep their characteristics or \nwelding properties intact. Do not use coils or portions of coils that are rusty. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n683 \n4.3.1.3. Special Applications. Dry electrodes for fracture-critical applications or when welding steel not shown in \nTable 1 in conformance with the manufacturer’s specifications and in accordance with AASHTO/AWS D1.5. \n4.3.2. Environmental Conditions. Do not weld when the air temperature is lower than 20°F; when surfaces are \nwet or exposed to rain, snow, or wind; or when operators are exposed to inclement conditions. Provide wind \nbreaks to protect welding operations from winds greater than 5 mph. \n4.3.3. Assembly and Fitup. Verify that ends of members to be welded are prepared in conformance with the \nwelded joint detail specified. Refer to Figures 3, 4, and 5 for proper end preparation and weld details of girder \nsplices. \nBring the parts to be joined by fillet welds into as close contact as possible, not separated more than 3/16 in. \nIncrease the leg of the fillet weld by the amount of the separation if the separation is 1/16 in. or more. Keep \nthe separation between faying surfaces of lap joints and of butt joints landing on backing strips to no more \nthan 1/16 in.    \nMake suitable allowance for shrinkage, and never restrain the joint on both sides in any welding process. \nUse the following fitup procedure for groove welds for butt joints. \n Align splices of beams and girders joined by groove welds with the center of gravity of both \ncross-sections coinciding or each flange vertically offset equally. Fit beams and girders with offset webs \nwith the webs aligned and the flanges offset laterally. Make the joint with a smooth transition between \noffset surfaces and with a slope of no more than 1:4 when flanges are offset or abutting parts differ in \nthickness or width by more than 1/8 in.    \n Space members to provide a 3/16-in. root opening at the nearest point. At other points of the joint when \nthe spacing provides up to a 7/16-in. opening, correction may be made by buildup up to 1/8 in. on each \nbevel nose. Rebevel openings exceeding 7/16 in. and move the parts to be joined closer together to \nbring the joint within the maximum buildup limits. Allow buildups to cool to the maximum preheat and \ninterpass temperatures before welding the joint. \n Bring all members into correct alignment and hold them in position using acceptable clamps while \nwelding. \nComplete all butt splices before welding diaphragms or sway bracing in a particular section of a unit. \nDiaphragms and sway bracing may be welded in a unit behind the splice welding to provide stability, except \nwhere such welding interferes with butt splice adjustments, such as at a drop-in segment of a continuous \nunit. Complete all splices before welding beams or girders to shoes. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n684 \n \nFigure 3 \nGirder Splice Details \n \n \nFigure 4 \nGirder Splice Details (Flange) \n \n \nFigure 5 \nGirder Splice Details (Web) \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n685 \n4.3.4. Preheat. Preheat ahead of welding both groove and fillet welds (including tack welding) to the temperatures \nshown in Table 3. Keep preheat and interpass temperatures high enough to prevent cracks. The preheat \ntemperatures shown in Table 3 are minimums, and higher preheats may be necessary in highly restrained \nwelds. Preheat the base metal when it is below the required temperature so that parts being welded are not \ncooler than the specified temperature within 3 in. of the point of welding. \nMeasure preheat temperature on the side opposite to which the heat is applied at points approximately 3 in. \naway from the joint. \nCompletely weld a joint before allowing it to cool below the specified temperature. Always deposit enough \nweld to prevent cracking before allowing a joint to cool. Do not allow preheat and interpass temperatures to \nexceed 400°F for thickness up to 1-1/2 in. and 450°F for greater thicknesses. \n \nTable 3 \nMinimum Preheat and Interpass Temperature for Welding with Low-Hydrogen Electrodes \nThickest Part at Point of Welding Temperature \nUp to 3/4 in., inclusive 50°F \nMore than 3/4 in. up to 1-1/2 in., inclusive 70°F \nMore than 1-1/2 in. up to 2-1/2 in., inclusive 150°F \nMore than 2-1/2 in. 225°F \nPreheat the material in accordance with Table 4 when E7010 or E8010 electrodes are used for tacking or \ntemporary root pass. \n \nTable 4 \nMinimum Preheat Temperature for Welding with E7010 or E8010 Electrodes \nThickest Part at Point of Welding Temperature \n1/2 in. and less 150°F \n9/16 in. through 3/4 in. 200°F \n13/16 in. through 1-1/2 in. 300°F \nMore than 1-1/2 in. 400°F \nUse preheat and interpass temperatures for the thicker plate thickness when joining steels of different \nthickness. \nPreheat base metal to at least 70°F when the base metal temperature is below 32°F and maintain this \nminimum temperature during welding. Preheat base metal to 200°F before starting to weld if it is moist. \nPreheat fracture-critical applications in accordance with AASHTO/AWS D1.5. \n4.3.5. Welding Practice. Use an approved procedure to control shrinkage and distortion. Weld FCAW in \nconformance with an approved WPS. Weld as required by the Contract or erection drawings. Do not change \nthe location or size of welds without approval. Do not make temporary welds for transportation, erection, or \nother purposes on main members, except as shown on the plans or approved. Use a crayon, paint, or other \napproved method to mark each groove weld to identify the welder who performed the work. \nUse the stringer-bead technique where possible for groove welds. Progress upward in vertical welding \npasses using a back-step sequence, keeping the end of the low-hydrogen electrode contained within the \nmolten metal and shield of flux unless the electrode manufacturer’s specifications indicate otherwise. \nBegin and terminate groove welds at the ends of a joint on extension bars. Make edge preparation and \nthickness of extension bars the same as that of the member being welded but extending at least 2 in. beyond \nthe joint. Remove extension bars using a cutting torch or arc-air gouging and grind the flange edges smooth \nafter the weld is completed and cooled. Clean any defects exposed by the grinding, fill them with weld metal, \nand regrind them to a uniform finish. Grind so that grind marks are parallel to the flange and avoid excess \ngrinding of the parent metal. Clean and fuse tack welds thoroughly with the final weld. Remove defective, \ncracked, or broken tack welds. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n686 \nGouge, chip, or otherwise remove the root of the initial weld to sound metal for all groove welds, except \nthose produced with the aid of backing or those on steel piling or armor joints, before welding is started on \nthe second side. Clean the back side thoroughly before placing the backup pass. Fuse the weld metal \nthoroughly with the backing, and use backing that is continuous for the full length of the weld. Make a \ncontinuous length of backing by welding shorter sections together only under the following conditions. \n All splices in the backing are complete joint penetration (CJP) groove welds made with the same \ncontrols as similar CJP groove welds in the structure. \n The welds are radiographed and examined as described in Section 448.4.3.7., “Radiographic \nInspection,” to ensure weld soundness. \n All welding and testing of the backing are complete before the backing is used to make the structural \nweld. \n4.3.5.1. High-Cellulose Electrodes for Root Passes. E7010 and E8010 electrodes may be used when welding the \nroot passes of beam and girder splices if the work is preheated in accordance with Table 4. Remove the \nE7010 or E8010 electrode pass completely by arc-air gouging and replace it using a low-hydrogen electrode \nafter the root passes are backed up. \n4.3.5.2. Welding Sequence. Make beam and girder splices using the sequences shown in Figure 6. (Some \nmembers will require fewer or more passes than Figure 6 shows.) Alternate welds from flat to overhead to \nprevent heat buildup along bevel edge. Arrange the passes between the top and bottom flange to maintain \nbalance and symmetry. \nPlace passes 1,\n 2, and 3 in the top flange, followed by passes 4, 5, and 6 in the bottom flange (Figure 6) for \nrolled I-beams and built-up girders. Gouge out and replace passes 1 and 4, which always are placed in the \noverhead position. Next, place passes 7, 8, and 9 in the top flange, followed by passes 10, 11, and 12 in the \nbottom flange. Continue with placing passes 13–17 in the top flange, followed by passes 18–22 in the bottom \nflange. Continue to alternate welding between top and bottom flange with at most five passes per flange until \nthe flange splices are complete. Tack weld web after aligning girder webs with short tacks as required to \nobtain proper alignment. Place pass 23 and pass 24 on the web. Gouge out and replace pass 23. Finish web \nsplice with pass 25. \nRemove all slag for each lay\ner, bead, and the crater area, and clean the weld and adjacent base metal \nbefore welding over previously deposited metal. Avoid arc strikes, and if they occur, grind resulting cracks \nand blemishes out to a smooth contour, checking them visually to ensure soundness. \n \nFigure 6 \nWelding Sequence for Splices for Material up to 50,000-psi Yield Strength \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n687 \nDeviation from the above sequence of weld passes requires approval.

Radiographically retest repaired welds. Make \nnecessary repairs before any further work is done. Additional RT required because of unacceptable welding \nor poor radiograph quality is at the Contractor’s expense. RT of particular welds shown on the plans is in \naddition to the RT required by this Item. \nMeet the requirements specified in Section 441.3.2.5.1., “Radiographic Testing (RT),” for radiograph film \nquality. \n4.3.8. Corrections. When welding is unsatisfactory or indicates inferior workmanship, the Engineer will require \ncorrective measures and approve the subsequent corrections. \nUse oxygen gouging or arc-air gouging when required to remove part of the weld or base metal. Back-gouge \nsplices in beams and girders or cut out defective welds using arc-air gouging by a welder qualified to make \nbeam and girder splices. \nSlope the sides of the area to be welded enough to permit depositing new metal where corrections require \ndepositing additional weld metal. \nUse a smaller electrode than that used for the original weld where corrections require depositing additional \nweld metal. Clean surfaces thoroughly before re-welding. \nRemove cracked welds completely and repair. Remove the weld metal for the length of the crack if crack \nlength is less than half the length of the weld plus 2 in. beyond each end of the crack, and repair. \nRestore the original conditions where work performed after making a deficient weld has made the weld \ninaccessible or has caused new conditions making the correction of the deficiency dangerous or ineffectual \nby removing welds, members, or both before making the necessary corrections; otherwise, compensate for \nthe deficiency by performing additional work in conformance with a revised and approved design. \nCut apart and re-weld improperly fitted or misaligned parts. \nStraighten members distorted by the heat of welding using mechanical means or the carefully supervised \napplication of a limited amount of localized heat. Do not let heated areas exceed 1,200°F as measured by \ntemperature-indicating crayons or other approved methods for steel up to 65,000-psi yield strength. Do not \nlet heated areas exceed 1,100°F for higher-strength steels. Keep parts to be heat-straightened substantially \nfree of stress from external forces except when mechanical means are used with the application of heat. \nBefore straightening, submit a straightening procedure to the Engineer for approval. \nCorrect defective or unsound welds either by removing and replacing the entire weld or as follows. \n4.3.8.1. Excessive Convexity. Reduce to size by grinding off the excess weld metal, leaving a smooth profile. \n4.3.8.2. Shrinkage Cracks, Cracks in Base Metal, Craters, and Excessive Porosity. Remove defective portions \nof base and weld metal down to sound metal, and replace with additional sound weld metal. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n689 \n4.3.8.3. Undercut, Undersize, and Excessive Concavity. Clean and deposit additional weld metal. \n4.3.8.4. Overlap and Incomplete Fusion. Remove and replace the defective portion of weld. \n4.3.8.5. Slag Inclusions. Remove the parts of the weld containing slag, and replace them with sound weld metal. \n4.3.8.6. Removal of Base Metal During Welding. Clean and form full size by depositing additional weld metal using \nstringer beads. \n4.4. Shear Stud Welding. Weld shear studs to steel surfaces and perform preproduction and production tests as \nrequired in AASHTO/AWS D1.5. \n4.5. Welding Reinforcing Steel. Splice reinforcing steel by welding only at locations shown on the plans. Before \nwelding galvanized rebar, remove the zinc coating at least 1 in.    from either side of the intended weld zone by \ngrinding or equivalent means. After welding, repair the galvanized zinc coating damage in the welded area in \naccordance with Item 445, “Galvanizing.” \n4.5.1. Base Metal. Provide weldable reinforcing steel in accordance with Item 440, “Reinforcement for Concrete.” \n4.5.2. Preheat and Interpass Temperature. Minimum preheat and interpass temperatures are shown in Table 5. \nPreheat reinforcing steel when it is below the listed temperature for the size and carbon equivalency range of \nthe bar being welded so that the cross-section of the bar is above the minimum temperature for at least 6 in. \non each side of the joint. Allow bars to cool naturally to ambient temperature after welding is complete. Do \nnot accelerate cooling. \nTable 5 \nMinimum Preheat and Interpass Temperature for Reinforcing Steel \nCarbon Equivalent Range (%) Size of Reinforcing Bar (No.) Temperature (°F) \nUp to and including 0.40 \nUp to 11 inclusive None \n14 and 18 50 \n0.41 through 0.45 inclusive \nUp to 11 inclusive None \n14 and 18 100 \n0.46 through 0.55 inclusive \nUp to 6 inclusive None \n7 to 11 inclusive 50 \n14 and 18 200 \nUnknown Up to 18 inclusive 500 \nBase the preheat and interpass temperatures for widening projects on the existing reinforcing steel and the \nrequirements shown in Table 5. \n4.5.3. Joint Types. Use butt splices for all No. 7 and larger bars. Use lap splices for No. 6 and smaller bars. \nMake groove welds in lap splices at least 4 in. long and weld them on each side of the lap joint as shown in \nFigure 7. For No. 5 and smaller bars, weld from one side of the lap when it is impractical to weld from both \nsides of the joint if approved, but in this case make the weld at least 6 in. long. \nMake all butt splices in the flat position. Make all welds for butt splices, except horizontal welds on vertical \nbars, as shown in Figures 8 and 9. The backup strip is required when access to the splice is from the top \nonly. When bars can be rotated or access to the splice is available from two sides, the double V-groove \nsplice may be used, and this type of weld requires gouging out the root pass similar to a flange splice on \nstructural steel. The root pass may be made using E7010 or E8010 electrodes for all double V-groove \nsplices. Preheat the steel to 400°F, if using E7010 or E8010 electrodes, and then completely remove the root \npass before welding the opposite side. Make horizontal splices on vertical bars as shown in Figure 10. \nProvide alignment strips as shown in Figures 9 and 10 to hold bars during welding operation. Trim alignment \nstrips after welding is complete. \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n690 \n \nFigure 7 \nDirect Lap Joint with Bars in Contact \n \nFigure 8 \nSingle V-Groove Weld in Horizontal Position \n \n \nFigure 9 \nDouble V-Groove Weld in Horizontal Position \n\n2024 Specifications  448 \n691 \n \nFigure 10 \nDouble Bevel and Double V-Groove Welds i   n Vertical Position \n4.5.4.

Use \nwood templates or other positive means to ensure correct positioning of anchor bolts not requiring steel \ntemplates. Positioning devices may be tack welded to the steel templates but not to any portion of the anchor \nbolts. \n3.3.1. Anchor Bolt Thread Lubricant Coating. Coat anchor bolt threads before installing nuts using an electrically \nconducting lubricant compound described in Section 449.3.3.2.1., “Definitions,” for traffic signal poles, \nroadway illumination poles, high mast illumination poles, intelligent transportation system (ITS) poles, steel \nelectrical service supports, and overhead sign support structures. Coat anchor bolt threads for other \nstructures with pipe joint compound or beeswax. After installing nuts, repair galvanizing damage on bolts, \nnuts, and washers in accordance with Section 445.3.4., “Repairs.” \n3.3.2. Anchor Bolt Tightening Procedure. Tighten anchor bolts for traffic signal poles, shoe base and concrete \ntraffic barrier base roadway illumination poles, high mast illumination poles, ITS poles, steel electrical service \nsupports, and overhead sign support structures in accordance with this Section. This procedure covers the \ntightening of nuts on a double-nut anchor bolt system using anchor bolts with 55-ksi or 105-ksi minimum yield \nstrength and UNC or 8UN thread series to secure structures to drilled shaft foundations. \n3.3.2.1. Definitions. The following definitions apply to the anchor bolt tightening procedure. \n Double-Nut Anchor Bolt System. An anchor bolt with two nuts that sandwich the structure’s base \nplate. The bottom nut is positioned under the base plate to level, support, and provide the reaction for \nthe force applied by tightening the top nut positioned above the base plate. \n Electrically Conducting Lubricant. A compound commonly used in the electrical industry to coat \nthreads of field-cut rigid metal conduit and suitable for exposure to weather. \n Impact Tightening. The tightening of nuts using a box-end “slug” or “knocker” wrench and a \nsledgehammer. The wrench, matching the size of the nut to be tightened, is driven with the \nsledgehammer to rotate the nut. \n Static Tightening. The tightening of nuts using a “spud” wrench and a pipe or extension handle. The \nwrench, matching the size of the nut to be tightened, may be turned using more than one worker to \nrotate the nut. \n Snug-Tight. The condition when the nut is in full contact with the base plate. It may be assumed the full \neffort of a worker on a 12-in. wrench results in a snug-tight condition. \n Turn-of-the-Nut Method. The tightening of top nuts to snug-tight condition, then establishing reference \npositions by marking one flat on each nut with a corresponding reference mark on the base plate at \neach bolt. Each nut is then turned to the prescribed rotation from the referenced snug-tight position. \n3.3.2.2. Anchor Bolt Tightening. Perform the following procedure. \n Coat the threads of the anchor bolts with electrically conducting lubricant. \n Install the bottom nuts on the bolts, one on each bolt. \n\n2024 Specifications  449 \n694 \n Level the top template (using it as a guide) by adjusting the bottom nuts so the template rests on each \nnut and the distance between the top of the concrete shaft and the bottom surface of the bottom nut is \napproximately 1/2 in.    \n Remove the template. \n Coat the bearing surfaces of the bottom nuts and washers with electrically conducting lubricant. \n Install bottom washers on bolts, one on each bolt. \n Erect and plumb the structure as specified. Adjust the bottom nuts so each is bearing equally on the \nwasher or base plate. The truss for cantilever overhead sign support structures and the mast arm for \ntraffic signal poles must be removed during anchor bolt tightening. \n With the plumbed structure supported by a crane, coat the bearing surfaces of the top nuts and washers \nwith electrically conducting lubricant. Install one washer and one top nut on each bolt. Turn the top nuts \nonto the bolts so each is hand-tight against the washer or base plate. \n Turn each bottom nut to a snug-tight condition using a wrench. \n Verify the structure is still plumb and still supported by the crane. Begin turn-of-the-nut method by \nturning each top nut down to the same snug-tight condition. Prevent rotation of the bottom leveling nut \nduring all top nut tightening.\n Establish reference marks for turn-of-the-nut method once snug-tight \ncondition is achieved, and then tighten the top nuts by turning each nut 1/12 turn (1/2 of a nut flat) past \nsnug-tight using either static or impact tightening. Turn each top nut an additional 1/12 turn until each \nnut has been tightened 1/6 total turn past snug-tight. \n4. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT \nTop or bottom templates, washers, lock washers, nuts, lock nuts, and other devices used for installing anchor \nbolts are considered part of the anchor bolt assembly. All work performed, materials furnished, equipment, \nlabor, tools, and incidentals will not be measured or paid for directly,  but will be subsidiary to pertinent Items. \n \n\n2024 Specifications  450 \n695 \n \nItem 450 \nRailing \n1.

Secure filter fabric in place with nails or pins. \nUse 12-in. long, 3/16-in. diameter nails with 1.5-in. washers, or U-shaped steel pins with each leg at least \n9   in. long. Space nails or pins at a maximum of 10 ft. in each direction and 5 ft. along the seams. Along the \nseams, place nails or pins through both strips of filter fabric at approximately the midpoint of the overlap. \nPlace additional nails or pins as necessary to hold the filter fabric in position. Alternative anchorage and \nspacing may be used when approved. Keep the fabric material free of tension, stress, folds, wrinkles, or \ncreases.  \nAny defects, tears, holes, flaws, or damage to filter fabric may be cause for rejection. Repair torn or \npunctured filter fabric by placing a layer of filter fabric over the damaged area, ensuring a minimum overlap of \n3   ft. beyond the damaged area in all directions, and securing the filter fabric in place with pins or nails. Store \nfilter fabric out of direct sunlight and cover the filter fabric as soon as possible after placement, but within \n3 days. \n3.4. Assembly and Installation. Place PVC-coated materials,  if wire coating is specified, when the ambient \ntemperature and the temperature of the coated wire are more than 15°F above the brittleness temperature of \nthe PVC. \nAssemble empty gabion or gabion mattress units individually and place them on the approved surface to the \nlines and grades shown on the plans with the sides, ends, and diaphragms erected to ensure all creases are \nin the correct position, the tops of all sides are level, and all sides that are to remain exposed are straight and \nplumb. Fill the basket units after transporting them to their final position in the work. \nPlace the front row of gabion or gabion mattress units first and successively construct units toward the top of \nthe slope or the back of the structure. Place the initial line of basket units on the prepared surface, and \npartially fill them to provide anchorage against deformation and displacement during subsequent filling \noperations. Stretch and hold empty basket units as necessary to remove kinks and provide a uniform \nalignment. Connect all adjoining empty gabion or gabion mattress units with lacing, wire spiral binders, or \napproved fasteners along the perimeter of their contact surface to obtain a monolithic structure before filling. \n\n2024 Specifications  459 \n709 \nProvide continuous stitching with alternating single and double loops at intervals of no more than 5 in.    i f \nlacing wire is used. Securely fasten all lacing wire terminals. \nProvide connections meeting the joint strength requirements in accordance with Article 459.2., “Materials.” \nThese requirements apply to all connections,  including attachment of end panels, diaphragms, and lids. \nJoin twisted wire baskets through selvage-to-selvage or selvage-to-edge wire connection; do not use \nmesh-to-mesh or selvage-to-mesh wire connection except where baskets are offset or stacked, in which \ncase join each mesh opening where mesh wire meets selvage or edge wire. \nCarefully fill the basket units with stone, using hand placement to avoid damaging wire coating, to ensure as \nfew voids as possible between the stones,  and to maintain alignment. Machine placement of stone will be \nallowed if approved. Correct excessive deformation and bulging of the mesh before further filling. Fill the \nbasket units in a row in stages consisting of maximum 12-in. courses t o avoid localized deformation. Do not \nat any time fill a cell to a depth exceeding 1 ft. more than its adjoining cell. Do not drop stones into the basket \nunits from a height greater than 36 in.    \nPlace two uniformly spaced internal connecting wires between each stone layer in all front and side gabion \nunits, connecting the back and the front faces of the compartments for gabion units more than 2 ft. high. \nLoop connecting wires or preformed stiffeners around two twisted wire-mesh openings or a welded wire joint \nat each basket face, and securely twist the wire terminals to prevent loosening. \nPlace the outer layer of stone carefully along all exposed faces and arrange it by hand to ensure a neat and \ncompact appearance. Overfill the last layer of stone uniformly by 1–2 in. for gabions and 1 in. for gabion \nmattresses to compensate for future settlement in rock while still allowing for the proper closing of the lid and \nproviding an even surface with a uniform appearance. Make final adjustments for compaction and surface \ntolerance by hand. Stretch lids tight over the stone fill, using an approved lid-closing tool, until the lid meets \nthe perimeter edges of the front and end panels. Do not use crowbars or other single-point leverage bars for \nlid closing. Close the lid tightly along all edges, ends, and internal c ell diaphragms with spiral binders or \nlacing wire or with other wire fasteners if approved.

Remove and replace pipe damaged by the Contractor at no expense to the Department. \n3.2. Laying Pipe. Start the laying of pipe on the bedding at the outlet end with the spigot or tongue end pointing \ndownstream and proceed toward the inlet end with the abutting sections properly matched, true to the \nestablished lines and grades unless otherwise authorized. Fit, match, and lay the pipe to form a smooth, \nuniform conduit. Cut cross trenches in the foundation to allow the barrel of the pipe to rest firmly on the \nbedding where bell-and-spigot pipe is used. Cut cross trenches no more than 2 in. larger than the bell ends \nof the pipe. Lower sections of pipe into the trench without damaging the pipe or disturbing the bedding and \nthe sides of the trench. Carefully clean the ends of the pipe before the pipe is placed. Prevent earthen or \nbedding material from entering the pipe as it is laid. Lay the pipe in the trench, when elliptical pipe with \ncircular reinforcing or circular pipe with elliptical reinforcing is used, so the markings for the top or bottom are \nnot more than 5° from the vertical plane through the longitudinal axis of the pipe. Remove and re-lay, without \nextra compensation, pipe that is not in alignment or shows excessive settlement after laying. \nLay multiple lines of reinforced concrete pipe with the centerlines of the individual barrels parallel.

Plaster the lower half of the bell or groove \nand the upper half of the tongue or spigot with mortar. Pack mortar into the joint from both inside and outside \nthe pipe after the pipes are tightly jointed. Finish the inside smooth and flush with adjacent joints of pipe. \nForm a bead of semicircular cross-section over tongue-and-groove joints outside the pipe, extending at least \n1 in. on each side of the joint. Form the mortar for bell-and-spigot joints to a 45° fillet between the outer edge \nof the bell and the spigot. Cure mortar joints by keeping the joints wet for at least 48 hr. or until the backfill \nhas been completed, whichever is first. Place fill or backfill once the mortar jointing material has cured for at \nleast 6 hr. Conduct jointing only when the atmospheric temperature is above 40°F. Protect mortared joints \nagainst freezing by backfilling or other approved methods for at least 24 hr. \nDriveway culverts do not require mortar banding on the outside of the pipe. \nFurnish pipes, with approval, that are large enough for a person to enter with the groove between 1/2 in. and \n3/4 in. longer than the tongue. Such pipe may be laid and backfilled without mortar joints. Clean the space on \nthe interior of the pipe between the end of the tongue and the groove of all foreign material, thoroughly wet \nand fill with mortar around the entire circumference of the pipe, and finish flush after the backfilling has been \ncompleted. \n3.3.2. Joints Using Cold-Applied, Plastic Asphalt Sewer Joint Compound. Ensure both ends of the pipes are \nclean and dry. Trowel or otherwise place a 1/2-in. thick layer of the compound in the groove end of the pipe \ncovering at least 2/3 of the joint face around the entire circumference. Shove home the tongue end of the \nnext pipe with enough pressure to make a tight joint. Remove any excess mastic projecting into the pipe after \nthe joint is made. Backfill after the joint has been inspected and approved. \n3.3.3. Joints Using Rubber Gaskets. Make the joint assembly in conformance with the recommendations of the \ngasket manufacturer. Make joints watertight when using rubber gaskets. Backfill after the joint has been \ninspected and approved. \n3.3.4. Joints Using Pre-Formed Flexible Joint Sealants. Install pre-formed flexible joint sealants in conformance \nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations. Place the joint sealer so no dirt or other deleterious materials \ncontact the joint sealing material. Pull or push home the pipe with enough force to properly seal the joint. \nRemove any joint material pushed out into the interior of the pipe that would tend to obstruct the flow. Store \npre-formed flexible joint sealants in an area warmed naturally or artificially to above 70°F in an approved \nmanner when the atmospheric temperature is below 60°F. Apply flexible joint sealants to pipe joints \nimmediately before placing pipe in trench, and connect pipe to previously laid pipe. Backfill after the joint has \nbeen inspected and approved. \n3.4. Connections and Stub Ends. Make connections of concrete pipe to existing pipes, pipe storm drains, or \nstorm drain appurtenances as shown on the plans. \n\n2024 Specifications  464 \n724 \nMortar or concrete the bottom of existing structures if necessary to eliminate any drainage pockets created \nby the connections. Repair any damage to the existing structure resulting from making the connections. \nMake connections between concrete pipe and corrugated metal pipe with a suitable concrete collar and a \nminimum thickness of 4 in. unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nFinish stub ends for connections to future work not shown on the plans by installing watertight plugs into the \nfree end of the pipe. \nFill lift holes with concrete, mortar, or precast concrete plugs after the pipe is in place. \n4.

Perform QA tests using either a high-speed or lightweight inertial profiler. \nCoordinate with and obtain authorization from the Engineer before starting QA testing. Perform QA tests on \nthe finished surface of the completed project or at the completion of a major stage of construction, as \napproved. Perform QA tests within 7 days after receiving authorization. \nThe Engineer may require QA testing to be performed at times of off-peak traffic flow. Operate the inertial \nprofiler in a manner that does not unduly disrupt traffic flow as directed. When using a lightweight inertial \nprofiler to measure a surface that is open to traffic, use a moving traffic control plan in accordance with the \nTMUTCD, Part 6, and the plans. \nIn accordance with Tex-1001-S\n, operate the inertial profiler and deliver test results within 24 hr. of testing. \nProvide all profile measurements in electronic data files using the format specified in Tex-1001-S. \n3.2.2.2.1. Verification Testing. The Engineer may perform ride quality verification testing within 10 working days after \nthe Contractor’s QA testing is complete for the project or major stage of construction. When the Department’s \nprofiler produces an overall average international roughness index (IRI) value of more than 3.0 in. per mile \nhigher than the value calculated using Contractor data, the Engineer will decide whether to accept the \nContractor’s data, use the Department’s data, use an average of both parties’ data, or request a referee test. \nReferee testing is mandatory if the difference is greater than 6.0 in. per mile. \n3.2.2.2.2. Referee Testing. The Maintenance Division will conduct referee testing, and the results are final. The \nMaintenance Division may require recertification for the Contractor’s or Department’s inertial profiler when \nthe results between the verification, Contractor, and referee testing are greater than 6.0 in. per mile. \n3.3. Acceptance Plan and Payment Adjustments. The Engineer will evaluate profiles for determining \nacceptance, payment adjustment, and corrective action. \n3.3.1. Surface Test Type A. Use diamond grinding or other approved work methods to correct surface areas that \nhave more than 1/8-in. variation between any two contacts on a 10-ft. straightedge. For asphalt concrete \npavements, when directed, fog seal the aggregate exposed from diamond grinding. The Engineer will waive \nsurface variation requirements for deficiencies resulting from manholes, permanent traffic markings, or other \nsimilar appurtenances near the wheel paths. Before performing work, the Engineer will determine whether \nrepair areas or crack sealing may result in reflective defects, and may waive surface variation requirements. \nFollowing corrective action, retest the area to verify compliance with this Item. \n3.3.2. Surface Test Type B. The Engineer will use the QA test results to determine payment adjustments for ride \nquality using Department software. IRI values will be calculated using the average of both wheel paths. \nWhen taking corrective actions to improve a deficient 0.1-mi. section, payment adjustments will be based on \nthe data obtained from reprofiling the corrected area. \n3.3.2.1. International Roughness Index (IRI)  Payment Adjustment for 0.1-mi. Sections. For asphalt concrete \npavements, unless payment adjustment Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 is shown on the plans, Schedule 3 will be \nused to determine the level of payment adjustment for each 0.1-mi. section on the project. Before performing \nwork, the Engineer will determine whether Surface Test Type A will be used instead of the specified payment \nadjustment schedule when the following conditions exist in existing travel lanes: \n travel lane is directly adjacent to existing curb and gutter, or \n\n2024 Specifications  585 \n841 \n travel lane has repair areas or crack sealing that may result in reflective defects. \nFor concrete pavements, payment adjustment Schedule 5 will be used unless payment adjustment \nSchedule 4 is shown on the plans. \nNo positive payment adjustment will be paid for any 0.1-mi. section that contains localized roughness after \ncorrective action is performed. \n3.3.2.2. International Roughness Index ( IRI)  Deficient 0.1-mi. Sections. Correct any 0.1-mi. section with an \naverage IRI of more than 95.0 in. per mile.  The Engineer may apply a $3,000 penalty if the IRI is greater than \n95 instead of requiring corrective action. No corrective action is required for Schedule 3 or Schedule 5. After \nmaking corrections, reprofile the pavement section to verify that corrections have produced the required \nimprovements. \nThe associated payment adjustment shown in Table 1 and Table 2 applies when successful corrective action \nimproves the IRI of a deficient 0.1-mi. section. \nIf corrective action does not produce the required improvement, the Engineer may require: \n continued corrective action, or \n application of the pertinent payment adjustment in accordance with Table 1 or Table 2. \n3.3.2.3. Localized Roughness. Measure localized roughness using an inertial profiler in accordance with \nTex-1001-S\n. The Engineer will determine areas of localized roughness using the individual profile from each \nwheel path. \nBefore performing corrective action, the Engineer and Contractor, together, will use a 10-ft. straightedge to \nconfirm localized roughness identified from inertial profiler results. Correct confirmed areas that have more \nthan 1/8-in. variation between any two contacts on the straightedge. \nThe Engineer will waive localized roughness requirements for deficiencies resulting from manholes, \npermanent traffic markings, or other similar appurtenances near the wheel paths. \n3.3.2.3.1. Localized Roughness Payment Adjustment. Instead of corrective action, the Engineer may assess a \npayment adjustment for each occurrence of confirmed localized roughness. No more than one payment \nadjustment will be applied for any 5 ft. of longitudinal distance. No payment adjustment will be applied where \nthe Engineer waived localized roughness requirements. For Schedule 1, a localized roughness payment \nadjustment of $500 per occurrence will be applied. For Schedule 2 and Schedule 4, a localized roughness \npayment adjustment of $250 per occurrence will be applied. For Schedule 3 and Schedule 5, a localized \nroughness payment adjustment will not be applied; however, corrective action will be required in areas not \nwaived by the Engineer. \nLocalized roughness payment adjustments will be evaluated within 0.1-mi. sections and applied unless the \nIRI deficient 0.1-mi. section payment adjustment is greater. When the IRI deficient payment adjustment is \ngreater, the payment adjustment in Table 1 or Table 2 will be applied. \n3.3.2.4. Corrective Action. Use diamond grinding or other approved work methods to correct IRI deficient sections \nand localized roughness. After corrective action is complete, perform the following. \n For asphalt concrete pavements, when directed, fog seal the aggregate exposed from diamond grinding \nor other approved work methods allowed.  \n For concrete pavements, when directed, groove the pavement longitudinally after diamond grinding. \n4. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT \nThe work performed, materials furnished, certification and recertification, traffic control for all testing, \nmaterials and work needed for corrective action, equipment, labor, tools, and incidentals will not be \n\n2024 Specifications  585 \n842 \nmeasured or paid for directly but will be subsidiary to pertinent Items.

When inclement weather prohibits placement of \nmarkings, the 14-day period may be extended until weather permits proper application. \n\n2024 Specifications  662 \n901 \nPlace standard longitudinal markings no sooner than 3 calendar days after the placement of a surface \ntreatment, unless otherwise shown on the plans. \nApply thermoplastic markings to a minimum thickness of 0.060 in. (60 mils). When paint and beads are \nallowed, apply to a minimum dry thickness of 0.012 in. (12 mils). \nPlace short-term markings in proper alignment with the location of the final pavement markings. Remove and \nreplace short-term markings not in alignment at the Contractor’s expense. \nFor removable placements, use of RPMs to simulate longitudinal markings is at the Contractor’s option. Use \nside-by-side RPMs to simulate longitudinal lines wider than 4 in. Do not use RPMs for words, symbols, \nshapes, or diagonal or transverse lines. \n3.2. Marking Removal. Remove markings that conflict with succeeding markings in accordance with Item 677, \n“Eliminating Existing Pavement Markings and Markers.” Remove short-term markings that interfere or conflict \nwith final marking placement immediately before placing final pavement markings, unless otherwise directed. \nRemove the remainder of the short-term markings before final acceptance. \nRemove all temporary markings with minimal damage to the roadway to the satisfaction of the Engineer. \n3.3. Performance Requirements. Ensure all markings are in accordance with Tex-828-B\n and are visible from a \ndistance at least 320 ft. (eight skiplines) in daylight conditions and at least 160 ft. (four skiplines) in nighttime \nconditions when illuminated by automobile low-beam headlights. Determine visibility distances using an \nautomobile traveling on the roadway under dry conditions. \nMaintain the markings for 30 calendar days after installation. The end of the 30-day maintenance period does \nnot relieve the Contractor from the performance deficiencies requiring corrective action identified during the \n30-day period. Remove and replace markings at the Contractor’s expense if they fail to meet the \nrequirements of this Item during the 30-day period. The 30-calendar day performance requirement will begin \nagain after replacement of the markings. \nEnsure daytime and nighttime reflected color of the markings are distinctly white or yellow. Ensure markings \nexhibit uniform retroreflective characteristics. \n4. MEASUREMENT \nThis Item will be measured by the foot or each word, shape, symbol, or temporary flexible reflective roadway \nmarker tab. Each stripe will be measured separately. RPMs used to simulate a marking will be measured by \nthe foot of marking or each RPM. \nThis is a plans quantity measurement Item. The quantity to be paid is the quantity shown in the proposal, \nunless modified by Article 9.2., “Plans Quantity Measurement.” Additional measurements or calculations will \nbe made if adjustments of quantities are required. \n5. PAYMENT \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \n“Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Work Zone Pavement Markings” of the type and color \nspecified and the shape, width, and size specified as applicable.

Ensure that the material is not heated to a temperature above the \nmaximum temperature recommended by the manufacturer. \nFor Type I markings, equipment must be capable of maintaining the thermoplastic striping material in a \nplastic state in all mixing and conveying parts, including the line dispensing device, until applied. \n4. CONSTRUCTION \nPlace markings before opening to traffic unless short-term or work zone markings are allowed. \n4.1. General. Obtain approval for the sequence of work and estimated daily production. Minimize interference to \nroadway operations when placing markings on roadways open to traffic. Use traffic control as shown on the \nplans or as approved. Protect all markings placed under open-traffic conditions from traffic damage and \ndisfigurement. Replace markings when more than 5% of the markings are damaged or disfigured. \nEstablish guides to mark the lateral location of pavement markings as shown on the plans or as directed and \nhave guide locations verified. Use material for guides that will not leave a permanent mark on the roadway. \nApply markings on completely dry pavement that passes the following tests. \n Type I Marking Application.  Place a sample of Type I marking material on a piece of tarpaper placed \non the pavement. Allow the material to cool to ambient temperature, then inspect the underside of the \ntarpaper in contact with the pavement. Pavement will be considered dry if there is no condensation on \nthe tarpaper. \n\n2024 Specifications  666 \n905 \n Type II and Type III Marking Application. Place a 1-sq. ft. piece of clear plastic on the pavement and \nweigh down the edges. The pavement is considered dry if, when inspected after 15 min., no \ncondensation has occurred on the underside of the plastic. \nApply markings: \n using personnel skilled and experienced in installation of pavement markings; \n that meet the requirements of Tex-828-B\n; \n that meet minimum retroreflectivity requirements; \n using widths and colors shown on the plans; \n at locations shown on the plans; \n in proper alignment with the guides without deviating from the alignment more than 1 in. per 200 ft. of \nroadway or more than 2 in. maximum; \n without abrupt deviations; \n free of blisters and with no more than 5% holes or voids (percent by area); \n with uniform cross-section, density, and thickness; \n with clean and reasonably square ends; and \n that are retroreflectorized with drop-on glass beads.  \nRemove all applied markings that are not in alignment or sequence as shown on the plans or in accordance \nwith the specifications at the Contractor’s expense, in accordance with Item 677, “Eliminating Existing \nPavement Markings and Markers,” except for measurement and payment. \n4.2. Spot Striping. Perform spot striping on a callout basis with a minimum callout quantity as shown on the \nplans. \n4.3. Surface Preparation. Prepare surfaces in accordance with this Section unless otherwise shown on the \nplans.  \n4.3.1. Surface Cleaning for Pavement Marking Applications on New Asphalt Surfaces with No Existing \nPavement Markings and for Retracing of Existing Pavement Markings on All Surfaces. Use air blast or \nbroom to clean the pavement surface to remove loose material unless otherwise shown on the plans. A \nsealer for Type I markings is not required unless otherwise shown on the plans. If cleaning is needed beyond \nwhat is specified, Engineer can use force account to compensate for the extra effort. This is mainly applied \nwhen the pavement is covered with thick layer of dirt or mud or there is grass growing on the pavement. \n4.3.2. Surface Cleaning for All Concrete Surfaces and Asphalt Surfaces Only When Specified in the Plans \n(Excludes New Asphalt Surfaces with No Existing Pavement Markings and Retracing). Clean surfaces \nin accordance with Item 678, “Pavement Surface Preparation for Markings,” to remove curing membrane, \ndirt, grease, existing loose and flaking construction markings, and other forms of contamination. \n4.3.3. Sealer for Type I Markings. Apply a pavement sealer when shown on the plans. Pavement sealers are \nrecommended for old asphalt surfaces (more than 3 yr. old) and for all concrete surfaces before placing \nType I markings on locations that do not have existing markings. The pavement sealer may be either a \nType II marking or an acrylic or epoxy sealer as recommended by the Type I marking manufacturer, unless \notherwise shown on the plans. Follow the manufacturer’s directions for application of acrylic or epoxy \nsealers. Clean the surface of sealer that becomes dirty after placement by washing or in accordance with \nSection 666.4.3.1., “Surface Cleaning for Pavement Marking Applications on New Asphalt Surfaces with No \nExisting Pavement Markings and for Retracing of Existing Pavement Markings on All Surfaces,” as directed. \nPlace the sealer in the same configuration and color (unless clear) as the Type I markings unless otherwise \nshown on the plans. \n4.4. Application. Apply markings during favorable weather unless otherwise directed. If markings are placed at \nContractor option when inclement weather is impending and the markings are damaged by subsequent \nprecipitation, the Contractor is responsible for all required replacement costs. \n\n2024 Specifications  666 \n906 \n4.4.1. Type I Markings. Place all Type I markings after the sealer cures. Apply within the temperature limits \nrecommended by the material manufacturer. Flush the spray head if spray application operations cease for \n5   min. or longer, by spraying marking material into a pan or similar container until the material being applied \nis at the recommended temperature. \nApply on clean, dry pavement passing the moisture test in accordance with Section 666.4.1., “General,” and \nwith a surface temperature above 50°F when measured in accordance with Tex-829-B\n. \nThe Engineer will measure thickness of markings in accordance with Tex-854-B. \n4.4.1.1. Non-Profile Pavement Markings. Apply Type I non-profile markings with a minimum thickness of: \n 0.100 in. (100 mils) for new markings and retracing water-based markings on surface treatments \ninvolving Item 316, “Seal Coat,” \n 0.060 in. (60 mils) for retracing on thermoplastic pavement markings, or \n 0.090 in. (90 mils) for all other Type I markings. \n4.4.1.2. Profile Pavement Markings. Apply Type I profile markings with a minimum thickness of 0.090 in. ( 90 mils) \nfor the longitudinal stripe portion.  \nIn addition, at a longitudinal spacing shown on t\nhe plans, the markings must be profiled in a vertical manner \nsuch that the profile is transverse to the longitudinal marking direction. The profile must not be less than \n0.30 in. (300 mils) nor greater than 0.41 in. (410 mils) in height when measured from the normal top surface \nplane of the base marking to the top of the raised profile marking. The transverse width of the profile must \nnot be less than 5.25 in. and the longitudinal width not less than 2 in., when measured at the top surface \nplane of the profile bar. The profile may be either a one or two transverse bar profile. When the two \ntransverse bar profile is used, the spacing between the bases of the profile bars must not exceed 0.50 in. \nThe above dimensions for transverse bars are for 6-  in. wide longitudinal marking.  \nThe raised profile markings must be uniform in size, appearance, and spacing. When profile markings are \napplied in a two-step process, the raised profile markings must be applied first and then the stripe applied \nover them. The raised profile markings in a two-step process may be circular in shape. The circular profile \nmarkings must be uniform in diameter and the diameter must not be less than 5.25 in. The height of the apex \nmust not be less than 0.30 in. (300 mils) nor greater than 0.41 in. (410 mils) when measured from the normal \ntop surface of the base marking to the top of the raised profile marking. \n4.4.1.3. Type I All-Weather Pavement Markings. Apply Type I all-weather markings to at least 100-mil film \nthickness. \n4.4.2. Type II Markings. Apply on surfaces with a minimum surface temperature of 50°F when measured in \naccordance with Tex-829-B\n. Apply at least 30 gal. per mile on concrete and asphalt surfaces and at least \n33 gal. per mile on surface treatments for a solid 6-in. line. Adjust application rates proportionally for other \nwidths. When Type II markings are used as a sealer for Type I markings, apply at least 22-1/2 gal. per mile \nusing Type II drop-on beads.  \nApply Type II all-weather markings to at least    25-mil wet film thickness.  \n4.4.3. Type III Markings. Apply in conformance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. \n4.4.4. Bead Coverage and Embedment. Provide a uniform distribution of beads across the surface of the stripe \nwith 40–60% bead embedment. \n4.4.5. Durability. Provide markings that do not lose more than 5% of the striping material in any 1-ft. section of \nstripe during their performance period in accordance with Section 666.4.8., “Performance Period.” Measure \nthe durability in accordance with ASTM D913.  \n\n2024 Specifications  666 \n907 \n4.5. Retroreflectivity Requirements. Retroreflectivity requirements are not required for Contracts with less than \n20,000 total ft. of longitudinal pavement markings, callout work, black shadow markings, or work zone \npavement markings.

Retroreflectivity Measurements. Use a mobile retroreflectometer to measure the retroreflectivity of \nmarkings for Contracts with more than 50,000 total ft. of longitudinal pavement markings, unless otherwise \nshown on the plans. For Contracts between 20,000 and 50,000 total ft. of longitudinal pavement markings, \nmobile or portable retroreflectometers may be used at the Contractor’s discretion. Coordinate with and obtain \nauthorization from the Engineer before starting any retroreflectivity data collection.  \nUse a portable retroreflectometer for measuring the wet continuous retroreflectivity in accordance with \nASTM E2832. Notify the Department when wet retroreflectivity measurements are to be taken. The \nDepartment will observe the wet retroreflectivity readings. \n4.6.1. Mobile Retroreflectometer Measurements. Provide mobile measurement averages for every 0.1 mi. unless \notherwise specified or approved. Take measurements on each section of roadway for each series of \nmarkings (e.g., edgeline, center skip line, and each line of a double line) and for each direction of traffic flow. \nMeasure each line in both directions for centerlines on two-way roadways (i.e., measure both double solid \nlines in both directions and measure all center skip lines in both directions). Furnish measurements in \naccordance with Item 667, “Mobile Retroreflectivity Data Collection for Pavement Markings,” unless \notherwise approved. The Engineer may require a field comparison check using a calibrated portable \nretroreflectometer for verification and to ensure accuracy. Use all equipment in conformance with the \nmanufacturer’s recommendations and directions. Inform the Engineer and TTI at least 24 hr. before taking \nany measurements. \nA marking meets the retroreflectivity requirements if: \n the combined average retroreflectivity measurement for a 1-mi. segment meets the minimum \nretroreflectivity values specified and no more than 30% of the retroreflectivity measurement values are \nbelow the minimum retroreflectivity requirements value within that 1-mi. segment; or  \n the combined average retroreflectivity measurement for a 1-mi. segment does not meet the minimum \nretroreflectivity values specified, but no more than 20% of the retroreflectivity measurements within that \n1-mi. segment are below the minimum retroreflectivity requirement. \nThe 1-mi. segment will start from the beginning of the data collection and end after a mile’s worth of \nmeasurements have been taken. Each subsequent mile of measurements will be a new segment. \nCenterlines with two stripes (either solid or broken) will result in 2 mi. of data for each mile segment. Each \ncenterline stripe must be tested for compliance as a stand-alone stripe. \nRestripe at the Contractor’s expense if the markings fail retroreflectivity requirements. Take retroreflectivity \nmeasurements of all restriped markings following the time interval allowed based on the type of marking and \nthe pavement surface for the latest application. \nFor all Type I markings, if the restripe application does not meet minimum retroreflectivity requirements or the \ninitial stripe combined with the restripe exceeds 0.180 in. (180 mils), the Engineer may require:  \n removal of all existing markings,  \n a new application as initially specified, and  \n a repeat of the application process until minimum retroreflectivity requirements are met.  \n\n2024 Specifications  666 \n909 \nFor all Type III markings, if the first application does not meet minimum retroreflectivity requirements, the \nEngineer may require removal of all existing markings, a new application as initially specified, and a repeat of \nthe application process until minimum retroreflectivity requirements are met.  \n4.6.2. Portable Retroreflectometer Measurements. For non-all-weather markings, provide portable measurement \naverages for every 1.0 mi. unless otherwise specified or approved. Using a portable reflectometer, take at \nleast 20 measurements for each 1-mi. section of roadway for each series of markings (e.g., edgeline, center \nskip line, and each line of a double line) and direction of traffic flow. Measure each line in both directions for \ncenterlines on two-way roadways (i.e., measure both double solid lines in both directions and measure all \ncenter skip lines in both directions). The spacing between each measurement must be at least 100 ft. The \nEngineer may decrease the mileage frequency for measurements if the previous measurements provide \nsatisfactory results. The Engineer may resume the original number of measurements if concerns arise. \nFor all-weather markings, take at least three measurements for each series of markings (e.g., edgeline, \ncenter skip line, and each line of a double line) and direction of traffic flow and average the three \nmeasurements for each marking. The spacing between each measurement must be at least 100 ft. If the \naverage of the three measurements taken on an individual marking falls below the minimum acceptable \nretroreflectivity value, take at least six additional measurements on that individual marking and average \nthem. These six additional measurements must also be spaced at least 100 ft. apart. If the average of these \nsix measurements falls below the minimum acceptable retroreflectivity value, the marking does not meet the \nperformance requirements. \nRestripe at the Contractor’s expense if the averages of these measurements fail. Retake portable \nretroreflectometer measurements of all restriped markings following the time interval allowed based on the \ntype of marking and the pavement surface for the latest application. \n4.7. Traffic Control. Provide traffic control, as required, when taking portable retroreflectivity measurements after \nmarking application. For the minimum traffic control requirements on low-volume roadways (as shown on the \nplans), refer to “Temporary Road Closure” in Part 6 of the TMUTCD. For all other roadways, the minimum \ntraffic control requirements will be as shown on the Traffic Control Plan (TCP) standard sheets TCP (3-1) and \nTCP (3-2). The lead vehicle will not be required on divided highways. The TCP and traffic control devices \nmust meet the requirements listed in Item 502, “Barricades, Signs, and Traffic Handling.” Time restrictions \nthat apply during striping application will also apply during the retroreflectivity inspections,  except when using \nthe mobile retroreflectometer, unless otherwise shown on the plans or approved. \n4.8. Performance Period. All longitudinal markings must meet the minimum retroreflectivity requirements within \nthe timeframe specified. All markings must meet all other performance requirements in accordance with this \nItem for at least 30 calendar days after installation. Unless otherwise directed, remove pavement markings \nthat fail to meet requirements and replace them at the Contractor’s expense. Replace failing markings within \n30 days of notification. All replacement markings must also meet all requirements in accordance with this \nItem for at least 30 calendar days after installation. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nThis Item will be measured by the foot; by each word, symbol, or shape; or by any other unit shown on the \nplans. Each stripe will be measured separately. \nThis is a plans quantity measurement Item. The quantity to be paid is the quantity shown in the proposal, \nunless modified by Article 9.2., “Plans Quantity Measurement.” Additional measurements or calculations will \nbe made if adjustments of quantities are required. \nAcrylic or epoxy sealer, or Type II markings when used as a sealer for Type I markings, will be measured by \nthe foot; by each word, symbol, or shape; or by any other unit shown on the plans. \nProfile pavement markings will be measured as a marking consisting of both the pavement marking stripe \nand the raised profile, regardless of the installation method used.  \n\n2024 Specifications  666 \n910 \n6. PAYMENT \nThe work performed and materials furnished in accordance with this Item and measured as provided under \n“Measurement” will be paid for at the unit price bid for “Pavement Sealer” of the size specified; “Pavement \nSealer (Call Out)” of the size specified; “Retroreflectorized Pavement Markings” of the type, color, shape, \nwidth, size, and thickness specified; “Non-Retroreflectorized Shadow Pavement Markings” of the type, width, \nsize, and thickness specified; “Type I High Performance Pavement Markings” of the color, width, size, and \nthickness specified; “All-Weather Pavement Markings” of the type, color, shape, width, and thickness \nspecified; “Pavement Marking (Call Out)” of the type, color, width, size, and thickness specified; or \n“Retroreflectorized Profile Pavement Markings” of the color, shape, size, and width specified. \nThis price is full compensation for application of pavement markings, materials, equipment, labor, tools, and \nincidentals. \nSurface cleaning for all concrete surfaces and asphalt surfaces only when shown on the plans (excludes new \nasphalt surfaces with no existing pavement markings and retracing) will be paid for under Item 678. Surface \ncleaning for pavement marking applications on new asphalt surfaces with no existing pavement markings \nand for retracing of existing pavement markings on all surfaces will not be paid for directly,  but will be \nsubsidiary to this Item. If cleaning is needed beyond regular brooming and blowing compressed air, the \nEngineer may use force account to compensate for the extra effort.

Field Comparison Checks Using a Portable Retroreflectometer.  At the beginning of each set of mobile \nmeasurement, collect at least one portable measurement to assess the accuracy of the calibrated MRDC. If \nrequested by the Engineer, take a set of field comparison readings using a portable retroreflectometer to \nvalidate the data collected by MRDC. The Engineer will select the location and the markings to be evaluated. \nThe number of readings should be at least 16 for each marking over the designated measurement interval. \nList the average portable retroreflectometer reading next to the mobile average reading for that interval with \nthe reported MRDC data. Request approval to take field comparison readings on a separate roadway when \nmeasuring a roadway where portable retroreflectometer readings are difficult to take. Take the off-location \nfield comparison readings at no additional cost. No more than one request will be made for each project \nunless the average of the portable measurements exceeds ±15% range of MRDC data. \nSubmit the printout and exported portable retroreflectometer data for all the readings taken for the field \ncomparison check with the corresponding MRDC data submitted. The mobile average reading must be within \n±15% of the portable average reading. The Engineer may require new MRDC for some or all of the \npavement markings measured during the time interval before a field comparison check not meeting the \n±15% range. Provide the new MRDC at no extra cost to the Department.  \nThe Engineer may take readings using a Department portable retroreflectometer to ensure accuracy at any \ntime. The Department’s Materials and Tests Division (MTD) will take comparison readings and serve as the \nreferee if there is a significant difference between the Engineer’s portable readings and the Provider’s mobile \nand handheld readings. For best results, take field comparison readings on a relatively flat and straight \nroadway when possible. \n3.7. Periodic Field Checks at Pre-Measured Locations. When requested by the Engineer, measure using the \nmobile unit and report to the Engineer immediately after measurement the average retroreflectivity values for \na specified pre-measured test location. The Engineer will have taken measurements at the test location \nwithin 10 days of the test. The test location will not include pavement markings less than 30 days old. If the \nmeasured averages do not fall within ±15% of the pre-measured averages, further calibration and \ncomparison measurements may be required before any further MRDC. Submit the MRDC results for the test \nlocation to be compared to the Engineer’s field check measurements. \n3.8. Measurement Notification.  Provide notification by email to Mobileretro@tamu.edu\n with a carbon copy to the \nEngineer at least 24 hr.  before MRDC to allow for scheduling mobile verification testing. \n3.9. Verification Testing. The Engineer or a third party may perform retroreflectivity verification testing within \n7   days of the Provider’s retroreflectivity readings. The Provider-submitted retroreflectivity data will be \ncompared to the verification test data to determine acceptability of the Provider’s mobile retroreflectometer \ndata. Comparison of the data will result in one of the following two scenarios. \n Provider’s Data Validated. If the difference between Provider’s and Engineer-third party data is 20% or \nless, then the Provider’s data is validated. The Provider’s data will be used for acceptance. \n Provider’s Data Not Validated. If the difference between Provider’s and Engineer-t hird party data is \nmore than 20%, then the Provider’s data is not validated. The Engineer-third party data will be used for \nacceptance and the Provider will be required to take corrective action before additional Provider data \ncollection and may require re-certification of the mobile retroreflectometer and MRDC system \noperator. If the Engineer determines that the Provider’s data might be correct, then referee testing may \nbe requested by the Engineer. \n3.10. Referee Testing. MTD will perform referee testing using portable retroreflectometers to determine whether \nthe markings need to be restriped to meet the required retroreflectivity level. The referee test results will be \nfinal. Referee testing will be conducted on the verification test sections using the method for portable \nretroreflectometers in accordance with Item 666, “Retroreflectorized Pavement Markings.” \n\n2024 Specifications  667 \n914 \n4. FINAL REPORT \nSubmit a final report in the format specified by the Engineer to the Department’s Traffic Engineering \nrepresentative within 1 calendar week after the service is complete. The final report must contain a list of all \nproblems encountered (pre-approved event codes) and the locations where problems occurred during \nMRDC. \n5. MEASUREMENT \nWhen MRDC for pavement markings is shown on the plans to be a pay item, measurement will be by the \nlane mile driven while measuring the retroreflectivity of pavement markings. \n6.
